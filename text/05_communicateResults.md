# Communicate Results

If you work with others, the results of your research need to be communicated, so
they can act upon your research results.

Aside from getting the results of your research across, communicating your
results has some positive side effects: collecting, organizing and summarizing
your findings will make it easier for yourself to remember your findings and you
may be even able to improve your analysis further.

This chapter is different from the others. In the chapters before, the focus was on the 
research itself. But what works well is highly dependent on what your audience is 
familiar with—and this is something that I can't know. So I could give advice on how to 
create a _persona_, but if your colleges base their work mainly on another framework, like
_Jobs-To-Be-Done_ the persona would not help. 

Because of this, the chapter gives some general advice, shows standard representations (like 
diagrams and scenarios) and the formats is mentions are conventional (like slide decks and reports).


## Consider the audiences needs

Who will receive the research results and what interests do they have? There may
be different stakeholders with different needs, e.g.

* Management
* Programmers
* Designers
* …

Some of their needs align, some may differ. Before you start, you should ask yourself
who will receive the results and what specific interests they have. Also inquire
if there is any preferred format. Some may prefer text-based reports, others may
be used to slidedecks.

## First things first

Structure documentation in a way that puts the essential information
first. A simple rule of thumb is this: If
a reader stops early at some point, they should already know the most crucial
information. Otherwise, it can happen that after reading half of it, the most 
crucial information has not delivered.
Also, it is motivating to deal with documents that put important matters first.
One can read e.g. the summary in the beginning and then decide that this is the
needed information and continue—or discard the document and don't waste time.

## Don't make it hard to understand
<!-- TODO: Translator-Metaphor: User to audience? -->
You create the documentation for people who are not user researchers and who
often have not taken part in the research. They won't understand any jargon of
your profession and maybe also not the vocabulary the users use. Thus, avoid
language that is hard to grasp or uses words unknown to your readers. Instead,
“translate” for them: Describe the research in terms they know and help them to
make sense of the participants’ language and actions.

As a rule of thumb, rather assume too little knowledge than too much. 
A person knowing something will just overhear or overlook an explanation 
while a person who lacks some background information is lost without it.

## Sections of a research documentation

There are some typical sections of a research documentation:

Executive Summary
: Summarize the research and its results in a few paragraphs.

Aim

: Summarize the research question you aim to answer with your research

Research Methods

: Describe how you gathered and analyzed the data. The research
in this guide uses  “interviewing and observation” for gathering the data and
“thematic analysis” or “qualitative clustering” as analysis methods (The terms
for the analysis are not 100% scientifically correct though since analysis
followed no “official” method)

Participants/Sample

: Describe how you got your participants and why you did
so. Show that you did not just got somebody, but people who were relevant to the
research needs.

Results

: The themes and consolidated diagrams belong here. They are the core of
your documentation. While most other content follows a pattern, the results will
be different each time. So be extra careful that the results can be understood
by the audience and use illustrations, photos and quotes to get your message
across.

Recommendations

: Sometimes you may give some advice for possible further
research or or designs.

Appendix

: If your audience is interested in digging deep your documentation you
can provide additional information here, e.g. an in-depth breakdown of your
themes or additional photos and sketches. If you provide material that is less
abstract, take extra care to check if the privacy of the participants is
maintained.

In a longer, written report you may have all of these sections. However, often
you will only provide a subset according to the needs of the audience e.g.  only
the executive summary and the recommendations in an email.

## Components of deliverables and reports

Let me give a brief overview of typical building blocks for communicating your
research. They are all useful on their own and you can combine them to use their
strengths together.

### Text

Text is as very versatile way to convey information. On the downside, text may
seem not as quickly accessible as a diagram or a sketch. To lower the barriers,
make sure that people know why they are reading your text. Give essential
information at the beginning (What is this text about? Why was the work done?)
and make sure that it is easy to get a quick overview:  Structure your text
using headings, lists and italics to guide the reader.

There are lots of books which explain how to write concise and easy-to-get text.
The most efficient guide I know was given by George Orwell in “Politics and the
English Language”—I quote:

> 1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used
to seeing in print.
> 2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> 3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> 4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> 5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
> 6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.

^[[Orwell’s Rules for
writers.](http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language)]

In addition, read the text aloud—in particular, if you already noticed that
you have had difficulties finding the right word or to express a complicated
concept. If you need to re-read sentences to make sense of them or to stress the
right words, you should go for a rewrite.

### Quotes

Quotes convey the participant’s motivations and feelings. This is important to
help others to have empathy with the users.

> **Rather abstract:** Users like the alignment function
>
> **Combined with Quote**: Users like the alignment function. Sandy: “It is like doing work by magic—click! And it’s there!”

Remember to protect the participant's identity if they did not give you the
permission to share their quotes or names. If they did not give you the
permission, only share a plausible, but faked “quote” and don't use real names
but pseudonyms (made-up names) ones as well. Don’t deceive your audience either: mention that the
names and quotes are not real but are only corresponding to their actual
counterparts.

### Scenarios
<!-- TODO: Explain why scenarios are great: 1) Communication 2) Current use 3) Future use 4) Allowing What if and it-is in one format. Also: Usability tests -->


Activities don’t happen in isolation from each other: They depend on previous
activities and (possible changing) motivations. One way to communicate a
sequence of interrelated activities is a scenario. Simply put, a scenario is a
short story written as text or given as a sequence of images (like a comic)

A good framework for writing scenarios is asking yourself these questions:

- **Person**: Who is the main person in the scenario?
- **Motivations**: Why does this person what he/she does? What is the motivation?
- **Activities**: What are the actions of the person and how are they done?
- **Context**: Where and When does the scenario take place?

Answer them in your scenario:

> Annika studies media culture and needs to finish her homework on “Cultural
subconceptualist theory in the works of Koons” in order to hand the homework in
on time. She goes to the library to see if the book on “Capitalism in the works
of Rushdie” by Andreas Geoffrey contains arguments supporting her view on the
structuralist paradigm.
>
> She enters the library and walks up to one of the
computers standing in the corners of the library's halls.
> She wants to look
up the name of the author, but she notes that she forgot the copy of the book
that referenced the work. She still knows that “Rusdie” or “Rushdie” was in the
title of the book she needs. After several trials she finds the right spelling
of the name and, after scanning through a list, she finds the book she wants to
read. The detail page of the search application gives the address of the library
building she is in already and a code: “X0-3R52”… \[scenario may continue\]

You could as well create a scenario as a series of sketches, like a comic strip:


![ **1** the search interface of the library's
computer **2** remembering the code. Is this character a zero or the letter
›O‹? **3** I can’t find the right shelf! **4** I'd better ask somebody… …now I know where I need to go!](images/Scenario-Bibliothek-all.svg)


### Diagrams

Diagrams are useful to show high-level concepts, relations and dependencies –
for example showing which activities need to be done to create a page of a
magazine or the ways a group of students shares files when working together on a
joint project.

You may use the summary diagrams you created in the analysis or create new
diagrams for this step.

### Photos and Illustrations

Which one is easier to understand and less ambiguous:

This:

> The participant’s desk is rather tidy. In front of the keyboard is a book and
on the book a calculator. Left hand are additional utilities, like…

Or that:

![](images/ObservationDesignU4Workplace.jpg)

I suppose the image wins.

While the above example just shows a setting, we could as well combine the
strengths of text and images in an annotated photo.

Or you could show your general findings about how people organize their desktops
by sketching a prototypical arrangement of items.

Illustrations and photos in particular have another function aside of getting
information across: They make the research and its findings more graspable,
intuitive and “real” for your audience. Just like scenarios and quotes they
enable to imagine how your research participants acted which in turn helps to
develop empathy for them. Consider again our example from above in which an
image and a text were compared. The photo does not only give some abstract
information. It shows that you have been with actual participant or—in this
case—did research on actual tools they use.

When using photos, remember to protect the privacy of your participants. Only
show photos of their workplaces or of themselves if they agreed to it.

## Typical documents for reporting results (“Deliverables”)

You can combine text, images diagrams and scenarios in several ways to
communicate your message. Let’s look at some possibilities.

### Quick findings

Quick findings are short, annotated lists of your most important findings. They
include only a brief description of methods, participants and environment. The
focus is on the most important results. Quick findings can also be delivered
before the analysis is fully finished. In this case, highlight that you are
still refining the research.

Quick findings are very useful if your audience:

-   already know about your research and want to have a look at your progress
-   have very little time, and need efficient access to your  results

### Written Reports

Written reports are roughly four to a several dozen pages long. Nevertheless,
only deliver what the audience needs and wants to know—be concise. It is easy
to get sidetracked and to write length and complex sentences.

Written reports consist mainly of text, but you should use images, quotes and
diagrams too when they make sense.

### Slides

<!-- TODO: slides with you talking or as a container for information without you being there in person? -->

Slides can deliver the same content as written reports or quick findings. They
convey the information in a more visual way—so they have fewer text and more
images, diagrams, and storyboards.

If you give the presentation yourself try to deliver as few as possible of the
information by text on the slides. You can do the talking and the slides
supplement the information you give. On the other side, it may makes sense to
use more text on the slides if you just share the slides with others and don’t
present them yourself.

### Posters

A poster is a great way to show the results in a way that is easy to grasp and
will be consumed too by people who do not take specific interest in user
research. They can be put up in a hallway for everyone who walks by.

Focus on a few important findings and show them using  graphical elements and text.
You also can create a big version of diagrams you created or summarized.
