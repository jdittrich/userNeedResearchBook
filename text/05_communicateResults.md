# Sharing research results

_This chapter covers:_

* _Understanding how research gets used_
* _Putting the most important information first_
* _Writing an easy-to-read style_
* _Creating helpful photos and diagrams_
* _Designing posters for quick and visual research summaries_
* _Creating slide decks to give an overview of your results_
* _Writing text-based reports to provide detailed information_


After the analysis, your work is almost done. However, people who have not participated in the research do not know anything about the research yet. You need to share your results, so they can learn about potential user’s motivations, activities, and problems. The most visible result for others will be the report or slide deck you create. 

> _Note:_ Sometimes the documents that are produced in user research are called _deliverables_—since these are the tangible results you can provide to a client after research. 

Documenting your research also has other uses than sharing the results or having an artifact that clients pay for. Creating the documentation continues your sensemaking from data. Now the focus shifts away from themes to priorities and expression: what are the key results? How can you formulate insights succinctly? These questions can also be worked on collaboratively, helping to deepen you and your collaborators’ understanding of the results.

<!-- You could even say that the interpretation goes on even after you reported the results, since people will re-interpret what the research results mean for them, in their situation. This also means that much like our analysis in the previous chapter there is not one right way to read a research report, only plausible and less plausible ones. -->


<!-- TODO: 1) What needs to be in place to engage with the report 2) What do people use the report for? -->

In order for people to engage with your research, they must assume that your research is useful for them. There are three areas where engaging in research can be helpful:

* Finding new directions for product development.
* Choosing between the directions, depending upon what is most promising in the light of the research results.
* Smaller, tactical decisions to be made in everyday design- and product management-work: Which of these features best fits the needs of existing users? What should be emphasized in a blog post promoting the update?

Your research should allow your audience to quickly understand and use the parts that are relevant to them. This will help them to use your research for both strategic and day-to-day decisions and to spread the word about the usefulness of research.

## Reports should be easy and quick to understand

There are key principles that make communicating your research easier: a clear structure, easy-to-read style, and well-used visualizations help create reports that are fun to read, use, and share.

### Putting first things first

Journalists put the most important information first and end with background information that is useful but not essential. This is known as the _inverted pyramid style_. You should try to do the same in your research reports. There are two reasons why this is useful to the readers: 

* When readers are pressed for time, they get the most important information quickly.
* If the readers have time, it makes them curious to read the rest: you have shown that there are interesting insights, now they want to know more.

Keeping this principle in mind also helps you and your collaborators to think about priorities: There may be many insights, but which are the most relevant? How can they be expressed succinctly and usefully?

A visible expression of these principles are headings, which reflect the most relevant points of the section. Summaries at the beginning of a section serve a similar function. Putting first things first also gets its own section in many research reports: An “executive summary”, a brief overview of the most relevant points of the report.

After you set the priorities of _what_ you want to communicate, let’s look at _how_ you communicate: the writing style.

### Easy-to-read style

Writing simple and vivid sentences will help your readers enjoy and understand your insights. A good text has actors and plot like a film scene you can imagine; Bad text feels static, describing gray concepts, arranged in lines of text. In your research, you observed participants in their activities and listened to them describing their motivations and problems. This is a great foundation for writing a text that is interesting to read.

One way to convey activity in your research is using “active” sentences. Active sentences make it clear who is acting: “Joe is looking for a recipe”. You could also write “The recipe retrieval process is initiated by the participant”—that puts the action in abstract, passive concepts and makes it hard to imagine what is going on. If you need an abstract principle, try to still frame it in terms of activities. Maybe you start writing something like “Existing skills are the foundation of the cooking process and are utilized as long as the situation makes sense for participants. Recipes are used when the local sensemaking process breaks down.” A long sentence with a lot of abstract words. However, the content could be interesting and much easier to read: “Participants use their existing skills. They fall back to recipes when they don’t know what to do next”. 

As a researcher, you translate experiences of your research participants so that your clients or team members can understand them. “Translate” is not just a metaphor: Participants, clients and team members often use different words. Terms your participants use may be very specific to their context and need to be introduced first. Many people are familiar with cooking, but even in our research, we may need to provide an explanation when quoting a participant speaking about _sauséeing_. In written reports, I sometimes explain words directly in the text or in footnotes and have also used small glossaries at the end of the reports. In slidedecks, I put such information in the speaker notes and included them in my talk.

Your research reports will be more enjoyable to read when you use action-oriented sentences and think about how to best translate the experience of your participants for your audiences. However, not all content comes as text: : it is also important to create good visuals

### Clear and helpful graphics

Not all findings are best expressed in text, just as not all data is best collected via conversations. Graphics can be very useful for both showing examples (like a photo of a participant cooking) and conveying abstractions (like showing the workflow steps in a diagram).

Like text, graphics should focus on what is most important: Too many flourishes and elements are distracting. You can often improve graphics by cropping them to the most important parts: If you focus on how people choose recipes, visualize recipe selection, not something else. If your photo illustrates how people knead dough, show the dough and kneading hands almost filling the whole picture rather than a wide-angle shot of the kitchen with a small single person kneading a tiny lump of dough somewhere.

Even if your graphic focuses on the most important content, it can still look unpleasant. This is often the case when elements do not line up and colors differ: There are variations, but it is not clear if they have a purpose or are accidental, like in the next image.

![Visualization of data processing steps. The diagram looks messy due to the inconsistencies in spacing, alignment, and fonts. Additionally, there are icons at each step, that do not add much meaning.](images/05_communication_graphicExample_Worse.svg){#GraphicExample_Worse alt="A not-great-looking diagram showing steps for data processing: System Catalog → (Export)→CSV Files (Modeling)→Open Refine (Reconciliation)→Quick Statements (Import)" }

Try to limit the different colors and fonts you use and pick ones that are obviously different. When arranging elements, align them with each other and make sure that repeating elements are evenly spaced. Following these hints will already lead to better looking diagrams:

![Visualization of data processing steps. The diagram looks clearer: spacing, alignment and fonts are consistent, the icons have been removed.](images/05_communication_graphicExample_Better.svg){#GraphicExample_Better alt="A better-looking diagram showing steps for data processing: System Catalog → (Export)→CSV Files (Modeling)→Open Refine (Reconciliation)→Quick Statements (Import)"}

Many tools like PowerPoint, Slides or Illustrator have distribution and alignment features that save you the work of moving all elements manually.

> _Tip:_ Designs, diagrams and picking photos needs expertise. If you can work with a visual designer, you can save yourself a lot of work and get high quality results. 

Visual elements like diagrams and photos should, like text, be focused on a clear purpose and avoid elements that detract from this purpose. Avoid flourishes, crop images to their most important content and use few fonts and colors in diagrams. This looks good and helps readers to make sense of the content quickly.


## Common forms of documentation

I will introduce you to three ways to summarize your research: Posters, slide decks and reports. These formats have different strengths, and complement each other. For a large project, you might create all three, while for a smaller project you might only deliver a slide deck or report.

<!-- TODO:  Tip or sidebar: send an early version of your deliverables to collaborators/close stakeholders. 

From previous version: 

### Quick findings

Quick findings are short, annotated lists of your most important findings. They
include only a brief description of methods, participants and environment. The
focus is on the most important results. Quick findings can also be delivered
before the analysis is fully finished. In this case, highlight that you are
still refining the research.

Quick findings are very useful if your audience:

-   already know about your research and want to have a look at your progress
-   have very little time, and need efficient access to your  results


 -->

<!-- roundtrip -->

### Posters

The great thing about posters is that they can become part of the environment the design team works in. The poster can be a reminder of the most important results, and team members can refer and point to it in conversations.

Posters are the most compact way to summarize your research: Only the most important results get on a poster. Text should be short and structured with headings. You can use graphics to their full potential on a poster. Complex processes or diagrams often suffer from the limited space they get in other media. Here they shine.

![Poster summarizing the research into improving cooking skills](images/05_communication_PosterExample.png){#posterExample1 alt="A poster showing a research summary and several research findings on how people learn to improve their cooking skills using recipes and videos"}

Other formats of posters may focus on a specific finding and visualize in depth. I did not do this for the research on using cooking instructions. The following image is an example from research I did on cleaning and transforming data before importing it into a public database, using multiple tools and skills from different domains:

![Visualization of data processing steps.](images/05_communication_graphicExample_Better.svg){#GraphicExample_Better alt="Visualization of data processing steps."}

> _Tip:_ Professional designers create posters in a desktop-publishing application like Adobe InDesign—but in many cases, a presentation application like PowerPoint works well too.

> _Tip:_ If you have an office printer that prints A3, you can use it for a small poster; Large format printers in print shops can print larger posters.

Posters can only provide limited information. This is a strength, as it helps you focus, but to provide background information and results that go beyond the essential findings, you can document your research in a slide deck. 

### Slide decks

Slide decks are versatile: they can serve both as a medium for documentation and provide important points and visualizations in a personal presentation. The limited space on each slide helps you to stay focused and write concisely. The slide format makes it possible to try different sequences and to put together longer or shorter decks depending on the information needs.

I often structure my slide decks like this:

* Title
* Research project question
* Executive summary: One slide with the most important results
* Brief research method description
* Result 1
* Result 2
* …
* Takeaways (Similar to executive summary)


There are different ways to organize information on a slide. A lot of research insights can be presented in lists:

![Slide with a list](images/05_communication_SlideList.png){#slidesList alt="A slide showing requirements for cooking with recipes and instructions that become obvious only when they are not met"}

Research results can feel quite abstract. One way to convey what you saw and heard while researching is by sharing quotes and image examples: 

![Giving a better impression of the research participants: Slide with quote.](images/05_communication_SlideQuote.png){#slidesQuote alt="A slide showing a participant quote (I thought it can’t be this hard, right?! But then I tried and it went quite badly) and an explanation of the context"}

![Giving a better impression of what you observed: Slide with photo.](images/05_communication_SlidePhoto.png){#slidesPhoto alt="A slide showing a photo of a bowl with cake dough. The slide’s heading reads:“The food is at the center, not the instructions”"}

You can use the slides to show diagrams and other forms of visualization. In the following slide, I visualize that recipes see straightforward, almost like algorithms, but that the actions that people do based on the recipe are far more complex: 

![Giving helpful abstractions: Slide with a diagram](images/05_communication_SlideDiagram.png){#slidesVisualization alt="two diagrams, one a simple progression, the other a rather convoluted process"}

One format I haven't used to present the results of recipe usage research, but that can be useful, is to compare, for example, which factors support and hinder the use of a tool.

![For decisions: Slide with pro/contra list.](images/05_communication_SlideComparison.png){#slidesComparison alt="a slide with a list for pro and a list of contra points"}

Such a summary is useful for evaluating (product) decisions and you can place it after the executive summary.

> _Note:_ There is some contradiction between what should be on slides for _documentation_ and what should be on slides for _presenting in person_. For presenting, slides should ideally avoid repeating points you are talking about—slide decks by professional speakers are often just illustrations and examples! If you want to deliver a top-notch presentation, consider creating a separate deck.

Slide decks are a standard format for documenting research results and are used beyond their original purpose of providing images and graphics for presentations. The format affords highly structured text and the use of illustrations and thus matches the needs of ad-hoc use and quick comprehension. However, it can be difficult to discuss complex issues and to provide background information for those who want to dig deeper. It is best to create a written report for these needs. 

### Reports

Written reports enable you to discuss results and methods in detail. They require concentrated reading. Depending on the research, a report can be about 15-50 pages long and can include a description of the methods, recruiting process and research session questions in an appendix. This makes them a good format for readers who need to deeply engage with the topic, but also for archiving and later reusing research results. The written report allows to present the relevant context, motivations, and reasoning. This helps readers understand research results even years later.

The basic structure of a report can be the same as that of a slide deck. In the case of a written report, it can be useful to include an appendix with a description of the method and a more detailed discussion of the results.

* Title
* Executive summary listing results, research question and brief method description (see [the following image](#writtenReportExecutive))
* Results
  * Result 1
  * Result 2
  * …
* Result summary
* Appendix
  * Detailed description of research methods
  * Recruitment method and sample
  * Research session questions (“interview guide”)
  * …

![Executive summary page from a written report](images/05_communication_ExecutiveSummary.png){#writtenReportExecutive alt="Executive summary page from a written report"}

Even if written reports demand focused reading, they should still be easy to understand and provide important information quickly. They should have an executive summary, and you can also summarize key points of their sections, much like in the chapters of this book. 

Reports allow you to detail your findings and provide background information for readers who want to delve deeply into the research and its methods. They are not the ideal medium for a quick overview. Your reports, no matter how extensive, will be build upon by their readers when they move beyond the immediate research results towards decisions and designs.

### Beyond reporting research results

For you, the research project usually ends with you documenting your research and presenting it to the team or other stakeholders. But the use of the research results has only just begun: If all goes well, team members and other colleagues will read use your posters, slidedecks and reports and share them with colleagues. They will also use the research to create documents slightly removed from research and more focussed on design or business decisions: Personas, empathy maps, scenarios, or story boards.

When your research reports are easy to understand and provide interesting information, product managers, designers, developers, and writers will use them to learn more about your participants and thereby creating products that match your user motivations, activities, and problems.

## Summary
* Research results can be used for strategic decisions as well as for smaller tactical ones.
* Structure the information inverted-pyramid-style: The most important information comes first.
* Use an active, concrete style.
* Focus your graphics on their core message and avoid elements that do not contribute to it.
* Posters give quick and visual research summaries.
* Slides give an overview of your results that is easy to consume.
* Written reports give in-depth information.
