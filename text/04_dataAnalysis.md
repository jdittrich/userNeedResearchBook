# Analyzing what you learned {#dataanalysis}

_This chapter covers:_

* _Learning the basic principles for analyzing and making sense of the data_
* _Making sense of diagrams and sketches_
* _Analyzing your notes_

Data analysis might not sound exciting: You have already  learned a lot from your participants, so why not just go ahead and skip the data analysis?

While you certainly have some really useful insights already, the full potential of the data isn’t immediately apparent. Some useful insight become apparent only when previously separate data comes together. 

The analysis also gives you the opportunity to reflect and critically evaluate your impressions: Sure, some ideas from your research sessions seem great, but do they make sense  in the light of other data?

The previous reasons for analysis focused on _you_ and _your insights_, but research for understanding potential users is often done _in_ and _for_ _teams_. When collaborating with others, you need to be able to show how you came to your insights. 

Research is often a team effort. Researching together helps to get a mutual understanding about the research. Analyzing together also gives your co-researchers a deep understanding of the research, even though they may not have attended the research sessions themselves.

> _Tip:_ You do not need to be finished with learning from participants before you start analyzing the data! It can actually be very helpful to start analyzing as soon as you have collected data from three or four participants. Analyzing the data can help you find under-explored topics. You can then adjust your questions and cheat-sheet accordingly to learn more about these topics. 

Data analysis helps you find patterns in your data and  establish research-based principles for product development. It allows you to reflect on your ideas and  discover non-obvious patterns. The analysis also creates the foundations to show that your insights have a solid foundation when communicating them. Analyzing with others allows teaching collaborators about the research by direct involvement in it.


## Commonalities and contrasts

You make sense of the data by constructing repeating patterns and principles from it. A core activity here is to compare data to other data and ask how they might fit together or not. This will help you to spot patterns, point out variations, and guide your research.

This is similar to what you do intuitively when confronted with something new: you ask how it makes sense given what you already know. Let’s say you go through your data and you read, “I cook meals that my kids like, but I’d like a bit more variety” and read another note that says “I can’t just cook anything—I should use the groceries I have already bought.” You can compare the notes and see there is a commonality: Both seem to deal with constraints and choice.

But not everything fits together. Insights can also come from contrasts: The constraints in the preceding notes are different—kids' preferences in one case, the groceries a person already has in the other. With that in mind, you could create a list of different types of constraints.

The commonalities and contrasts you construct can also guide your research: They help to find interesting questions both to learn from the participants and to analyze what you learned. You could try to figure out how the constraints play out in a broader context: Maybe people are starting to plan for the long-term to avoid constraints? Maybe the person who uses what they have actually takes pride in being good at avoiding waste and the limitation is more of a resource for them?

Understanding your data by interpreting commonalities and contrasts is a fundamental activity in analyzing data. It can lead to insights into patterns and differences in your data. It also can raise questions that require more data or different perspectives to get answers.

## Doing the “right” analysis

In [“Learning from Research Participants”](#rightAnswers), I wrote about the issue of influence in interviews and observations. I have said that researchers can’t take themselves out of the research and that their approach has an impact on the results—but also that this is a strength of the method and not something we can and should avoid.

Your impact on the results of the analysis is similar. Even if the same data is analyzed, different people will come to different conclusions. This is because the result of the analysis depends on the reasonable, but still individual and debatable, interpretation of the data: You might think that an utterance like, “I add some sugar here, even thought the recipe does not say so,” should be best interpreted as “loves sweetness.” But it could be that this should be seen rather as an expression of “personal creativity” or “need to improve the recipe.” There is no right or wrong interpretation; but your analysis needs to be plausible, comprehensible and based on the data you collected.

Imagine, as a kid, you had a pile of bricks you wanted to build a house with. These bricks were like the not-yet-analyzed data you start with. When you did build a house from these bricks, there is no single “right” building. But neither was it an arbitrary process of connecting bricks randomly.

Building a house from bricks is like analyzing data. Just as there is not _one_ correct house to build, there is no _one_ correct analysis. But it is also not an arbitrary process: There are many, many ways to combine the bricks _in some way_, but only a few of these ways will result in something that can plausibly be called a house.

![Many bricks, but clearly no house.](images/04_analysis_brickPile2.jpg){#bricksNoHouse alt="A pile of toy bricks. There are many white ones and some red ones (windows, roof-pieces etcetera )"}

What the house will look like in the end is not certain from the outset. You will change designs, move walls, and sometimes try to use the same piece in different parts of the building,

![A way to use the bricks to build a house](images/04_analysis_houseFinished.jpg){#plausibleHouse alt="A house build from toy bricks. It has a roof terrace with a mini figure on it and a small garden in front with flowers, a tree and a postbox"}

Almost the same applies to your analysis. You will move walls and bricks but will adjust interpretations and organize your data into different structures. As with the bricks, there are many ways to structure the data, but only some of them will create something meaningful to you and others. This creation of a meaningful structure is not set at the start but is a process, just like building the house from bricks. You will try, fail, try again, think it is somewhat okay, find improvements to it and gradually move closer to a structure you are happy with.

## A process for making sense of diagrams

In [the chapter on co-documenting](#coDocumenting) I introduced (co-) documenting via:

* Lists and flowcharts, for example, the steps required  to prepare an espresso.
* Charts, for example, how the mood changes over the day.
* Maps of places, for example, where something is in a kitchen.
* Maps of relations, for example, which people helped you to learn to cook.

Now, we focus on how to analyze them and put them into an easy-to-grasp form. The process has three steps:

1. Preparing diagrams
2. Finding commonalities and contrasts
3. Summarizing the diagrams in a diagram of your own.

> _Note:_ You can interweave both analyzing diagrams and analyzing your notes. Although I have described the methods of analysis in different sections of this book, you can use one to better make sense of the other.

### Preparing diagrams

Annotate the diagrams with potential interpretations to prepare for analysis. For this, you can photocopy the diagrams and write on the copies.

> _Note:_ If you like to keep it digital, you can use any application that can add text over images, for example [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

If you are collaborating with others, it makes sense to distribute the initial annotations among the group. After that, everyone shares their annotations and others can ask questions or suggest additions or changes. In this way you will receive diverse input and a common understanding.

My example in this section are diagrams where people have drawn their process of cooking or baking and what made them feel good or bad about it.

![Example of an annotated diagram](images/04_analysis_cookingGoodBad1.png){#cookingGoodBad1 alt="A diagram showing a graph that indicates the mood of the participant during the process of cooking a meal, including its preparation. There are annotations drawn on top in different colors."}

In this diagram, I made the following annotations:

* I highlight sections of the process with rectangles of different colors. In later steps I can see if these make sense in diagrams by other participants
* Early on, the participant were looking for recipes, which caused them ups and downs in quick succession. This is similar to what the participant experiences while cooking.
* Shopping is fun for our participant.
* There is an explicit gap between finding recipes and getting ingredients (I wonder if other participants will highlight something similar?).
* There is a setup phase before they started cooking (Again, will others have this, too?).
* Eating seems to be about as fun as cooking. The memories of the meal are what is positive (The explicit focus on memories is interesting!).

When you annotate multiple diagrams, you intuitively begin to compare diagrams with each other. I describe this in the next section, but in practice, both activities are intertwined.


### Finding commonalities and contrasts

When you have thought of possible interpretations of the diagrams you have, you can compare them among each other. Do they show the same pattern or do they differ? If yes, where and why? When doing this, you can overthrow or update your initial interpretations and find common patterns as well as highlight interesting features.

![An annotated diagram by another participant](images/04_analysis_cookingGoodBad2.png){#cookingGoodBad2 alt="A diagram showing a graph that indicates the mood of the participant during the process of cooking a meal, including its preparation. There are annotations drawn on top in different colors."}


When comparing the diagram from the previous section to this the one here, there are similarities and differences:

* The participant here seems to base their decision on what ingredients they currently have at home. This also involves and iteration phase to figure out what to cook, similar to the initial iterations of the diagram in the previous section.
* The process of finding a meal to cook can have small successes and failures—the mood goes up and down. This is similar to “search a recipe” in the previous diagram.
* In both diagrams, cooking is a positive experience.
* Serving the food is the (positive) end of the process; the previous diagram actually ended with a focus on _memories_ of the meal.

This also led to some questions I ask myself when looking at the few diagrams:

* Is the process of recipe selection usually described as iterative and trial and error? (Our two diagrams so far imply such a process)
* What is the last step for other participants? (Serving? Memories? Something else?)
* I am not sure about what happens during “cooking”. Maybe the diagrams are not the ideal way to get details there, but I am curious if there will be diagrams that tell me more.

This is just one comparison of several that would follow.

By constantly comparing what we learned from previous diagrams with additional diagrams, we learn about repeating patterns and possible variations. After comparing all the diagrams we currently have, it is time to summarize what we learned.

## Summarize what you learned

You can summarize the results yourself in a diagram. It will look similar to the ones the participants drew. In this diagram, you will include insights that showed in several diagrams. Sometimes I also add data that I can't necessarily confirm as repeating in the data, but that I find interesting.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->

Based on the diagrams used in the previous steps as well as diagrams from more participants, I created the following summary diagram:

![The diagrammatic summary of the analysis](images/04_analysis_cookingGoodBadSummary.png){#cookingGoodBadSummary alt="A diagram showing a graph that indicates the mood of the participant during the process of cooking a meal, including its preparation. There are annotations drawn on top in different colors."}

* I could not find a consistent pattern for the preparation: Some participants did  choose the recipe first and then bought the ingredients they needed, other participants  chose recipes for the ingredients they had at home.
* There was also no consistency in what they liked or disliked about the preparation, for example, some loved shopping, others disliked it.
* Some participants planned their cooking and prepared it a few days before cooking.
* All participants enjoyed cooking.
* The participants often drew the cooking process with a slightly wiggly line: There were usually little problems or uncertainties that participants needed to solve.
* One participant spoke about a case that went wrong. . Although it was only mentioned by one participant, I found it interesting for two reasons: the inclusion showed that processes are not predetermined, and it also showed that errors are not a general error, but are fixed.

By creating a summary diagram you can present your findings in a form that is quick to grasp and maintains a link to the original diagrams that our participants drew.

I mentioned previously, that you can intertwine analysis of diagrams and notes. In this section I covered diagrams; next I show how to make sense of research notes.

## A process for making sense of notes

Your notes are data in written form, maybe with some occasional sketches. I will demonstrate a method to analyze your notes in depth. In contrast to the methods for analyzing diagrams, this is more complex. However, it is a very powerful method that allows going beyond the data to create meaningful interpretations that can guide future design work.

### Organize notes hierarchically

The basic unit for our analysis are the utterances or observations which are usually represented by a line in your transcript. For example, a line in your transcript could be: “I usually try a new recipe when I think its fun and have a reason to bake a cake, birthdays, or something like that.“

You organize these notes hierarchically and create groups that share a common theme. You give each group a title that states the theme of the underlying of data.

Sometimes you will have multiple related themes that form a common theme. In this case, it makes sense to make a group of groups with a title stating the overarching theme of this group of groups.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->

Here is a part of an analysis showing data organized in themes and sub-themes:

* Overarching theme: Finding inspiration/New Recipes
  * Sub-theme: Stumble on content
    * Data: Sometimes something baking-related pops up on YouTube
    * Data: Online news sites sometimes have recipes
    * …
  * Sub-theme: Direct search, when there is a specific reason
    * Data: “I wanted to bring a cake for a party of a friend, so I looked for something with chocolate (they like it)
    * Data: “After going vegan, I looked for variants of non-vegan food I liked”
    * …
  * Sub-Theme: Recommendations from friends
  * …

Such a hierarchical analysis could be done in two ways:

* Top-Down: You name the groups and write the titles first,  and then sort pieces of data into the groups.
* Bottom-Up: You start by grouping data that appears to have a similar theme, and then give the group a comprehensive title which states the topic shared by the underlying data.

In this book, I will start by describing how to do the analysis bottom-up to develop themes based on data. Later, when you have created some themes, you can use both methods: You develop themes from data, but you also check where and how data matches with already developed themes.

Themes can grow over time as you add notes to the theme. Consider this group:

* Sub-theme: Finding recipes
  * Data: Sometimes, something baking-related pops up on YouTube
  * Data: Online news sites sometimes have recipes

When I have this note: _“I wanted to look up how much lentils go in the soup and while searching for the recipe, I saw a great photo of a chocolate nut cake”_, it makes sense to group it under the “Finding recipes”-theme, too.

This is just a simple overview of the process. In practice, you will also spend time sifting through data, rewriting theme titles and may need to take a step back to find a new way to make sense of your data.


### Create meaningful groups

<!-- possibly pointing out that this needs to be pointed out to others? -->

I already talked about grouping notes by themes they have in common. A theme is a statement that describes an insight about the notes in its group. It should be meaningful on its own. In this section, I discuss what this means practice and how you can spot themes that need improvement.

One way to group notes and to derive a theme would be to go through the notes and see which utterances and observations mention the same thing or give the same assessment.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->
Let’s say, you collected this data in our research:

* I just search recipes again online
* My recipes are in this stack of paper.
* When I find a good recipe, I print it and put in a section in this folder.
* I bookmark recipes in my browser.

If you put the notes which mention the same things in the same group, you get these two groups:

* Paper recipes
  * My recipes are in this stack of paper.
  * When I find a good recipe, I print it and put in a section in this folder.
* Digital Recipes
  * I bookmark recipes in my browser.
  * I just search recipes again online.

<!-- EXAMPLE-END -->

Organizing the notes by this _same things mentioned_-method would help us find notes concerned with a specific thing or assessment: If you want to see everything that related to recipes on paper, you can go through the notes in one group; If you would like to know about digital recipes, you could look it up in the other group.

However, organizing by the “same things mentioned”-method has its weaknesses: A theme named “digital recipes” only communicates  that the underlying notes are _somehow_ related to digital recipes. You still need to go through the underlying notes to find out what participants did with their digital recipes, what motivates them or which problems they face.

The names of themes created by organizing by the same things mentioned-method are just labels for the content and have no meaning on its their own: “digital recipes” does not tell you anything interesting itself. However, you can create themes that stand on their own if you created them based on the insights you can draw from the notes in the group.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->
If you use the same notes but organize them based on insights, it might look like this:

* Theme : Avoid active organization
  * Data: I just search recipes again online
  * Data: My recipes are in this stack of paper.
* Theme: Active organization
  * Data: I bookmark recipes in my browser
  * Data: When I find a good recipe, I print it and put in a section in this folder.
<!-- EXAMPLE-END -->

If you organize notes by themes based on insights about the participants and summarize those insights in the group’s titles, the title is a useful piece of information in itself, like “(Participants) avoided active organization”: The theme is not just useful for accessing the notes in it but an empirically-based principle can be considered when designing.

When designing, a theme based on an insight such as “Cooking is self-expression” can inspire the implementation of functions to present photos of meals, integration into social media and honing one’s skills.  The insight that “people often have unique constraints to what they can or want to eat” may lead creating a feature that allows to filter recipes for according to different criteria. The app also would not teach  vegetarians skills like de-boning chickens, and may provide cues on how to alter recipes to meet individual requirements. If you have a new idea you can ask: “Does this idea follow what is stated in the group titles? Does it violate them?”.

Grouping your notes based on insights about your participants provides great benefits. But it can be difficult and may not be possible for all your data. Therefore, creating groups using the same-things-mentioned method is still useful. These groups may still evolve to insight-based themes. Usually, I have some “same-things-mentioned”-groups in the beginning and far fewer at the end—but my analysis will be a mixture of both styles.

<!-- roundtrip-->

### Prepare your notes for analysis

When you create groups of data, it is good to know whether the theme of the group is relevant to several participants or only relates to one participant. To be able to check this, you should provide each note (=line in the transcript) with a participant code. You have already used this code in the section on archiving your data to indicate which participant the recorded data belongs to. A participant code works like a pseudonym: You identify the participant not by the name they usually use, but by a substitute identifier. I use neutral number codes: The first person I did a research session with is P1, the second is P2, etcetera.

You simply add the participant code at the end or beginning of each line. It is not the most exciting work, but it is done quickly: Copy the current code (like “P1”) to the computer’s clipboard (using the keyboard shortcut _Ctrl+C_), place the cursor with the arrow keys and the end/home keys on your keyboard and paste the code (_Ctrl+V_).


### Annotate your notes

After you added your participant codes, you can start to reviewing and annotating your notes to find possible interpretations, themes, and meanings in the observations and utterances. This will help you to  familiarize yourself with the data.

Annotations can be complete sentences or short lists. Usually, they concern a line in the transcript, but you can also comment on whole sections or just at individual words.

As an example, here are annotations I added to two lines in my notes:

* “I don’t know how to make a sponge mixture” (she buys it ready-made) _Note: Use of prepared/buy-able ingredients; possible group: “Externalization”_
* “I rather add some more oil, here, this is not enough” _Note: Expanding original recipe; expression of taste?; correction?_

<!-- EXAMPLE-END -->

The annotations should be easy to distinguish from data you got directly from the observation or the participant’s answers.

You can print out your transcript with wide margins and write your comments in the margins. With pen and paper, you can quickly jot down your thoughts, circling and connecting interesting parts with lines.  It will look messy, which is no problem, since your annotations are primarily intended for familiarizing yourself with the data, not for creating publishable comments on data.

If you prefer to work on the computer, you can annotate your data using a word processor with a comment function. Open your transcript, select the text you want to annotate, then click the “comment” button or menu entry. If you don’t use the comment function, but plain text, mark your comments by prefixing them with  something like “COMMENT:” or “ANNOTATION:”

Annotating your data is a creative process. When in doubt, whether an annotation is relevant or not: choose to write it. It might be useful later. Because you keep data and comments distinct, you can always throw comments out. The goal is not to come up with great annotations, but to engage with the data and to find possible ways to interpret it.

<!-- roundtrip -->
### Decide whether data should be held by lines or sticky notes

After annotating your data, you should decide which media you want to use for your analysis:

* In a word processor, where lines are the basic units of data
* Using analog or digital sticky notes that represent the basic units of data

The analysis methods described here can be used in both media. However, each media has different strengths.

Analysis in a word processor is lightweight: Any word processor will do the job. However, it does not lend itself very well to collaboration: Even when your software allows for collaborative editing, the process is a bit cumbersome. When it comes to collaboration, sticky notes shine: It is a very direct and intuitive process to move data around. This is especially true for using physical rather than digital sticky notes.

> 
> My suggestion is starting with the grouping approach I discuss here. After you gained some experience, check out some qualitative analysis applications and see if their approach suits you.

Regardless of how you analyze, you will do similar activities: You need to get your data in an appropriate  format, you need to know how to cluster data in groups, and you need to give the groups meaningful titles. In the next sections, I describe how you can do these basic activities in a word processor or using sticky notes.

<!--roundtrip-->

#### Analysis in a word processor

For getting your data in a suitable format, I suggest the following steps:

1. Create a new document
2. Paste your transcript into that document
3. Add a page break before the transcript to separate not-yet-grouped data from your (upcoming) structure of lines grouped by themes.

In a word processor, you cluster your data by moving lines close to each other, so you can put them in a bulleted list. You can rearrange lines using copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop.

To name groups of notes, put a headline above the list of notes that represents your group. Create a hierarchy by using different paragraph styles—bigger headlines for overarching themes-of-themes, smaller headlines for themes. If you use paragraph styles to format your headlines, you can use the navigation tool of the word processor navigate through your structure, which is very useful.

#### Analysis via sticky notes

For getting your data in a suitable format, you need to print your notes. I describe one way to do this in the tip below.

For creating groups of notes, you simply move sticky notes closer together. This is great for expressing varying degrees of certainty. When you are confident in a group you can order the notes in clear rows or lines, while sticky notes you are not sure about yet might just be close, but not yet in the cluster.

For group titles, use sticky notes in a different color—write your group titles on sticky notes and add them to the group. Color-coding by hierarchy can be helpful: If you print your data points on white paper, you can use yellow sticky notes for group titles and pink ones for titles of a group of groups.

> _Tip:_ Printing data for analyzing on sticky notes
> 
> When you want to do your analysis on analog printed notes, you need to print them. Here is the setup I use:
> 
> 1. Create table in a word processor with 2 columns and many rows. Each table cell will be a note.
> 2. In the table settings…
>   * …switch off “Allow row to break across pages”, so that one note/table cell will not be split between pages.
>   * … choose a decent padding around each cell, like 0.5 cm
> 3. Choose a font size of about 12-14pt: You need to be able to read them easily from an arm’s length distance
> 4. Copy/paste all your data (line by line) from the transcript into the cells.

After this, you print it and cut out the cells. The only thing that is missing is actually being able to stick the notes on the wall. You can use restickable glue or tape, though I mostly use simple masking tape.

After annotating your notes and deciding between analysis on sticky notes or in a word processor, you can now start with structuring your data.

### Develop a first structure {#developFirstStructure}

Structuring your notes means grouping similar data together, suggesting themes behind the data, naming these themes and deciding which data falls under which theme.

Structuring your notes is an iterative process and not done all at once. When developing a first structure, you don’t use all your data yet. You can start with what you find useful when skimming through, or you can use the data of two participants for now. The goal is to set up some preliminary structure.

![Developing a first structure is like trying out where you would put walls in your brick-build house: You can and will change them later, but they give your work needed structure](images/04_analysis_houseFirstStructure.jpg){#houseFirstStructure alt="A house made of toy bricks in its early stages; there is just the baseplate and some provisional walls."}

When you analyze together with others, it usually makes sense for each of the researchers to start to work on a fraction of the notes themselves in parallel. Announce to others when you create a group and consult with co-researchers when you are unsure about the interpretation and grouping of a note.

There are two initial activities when developing a first structure: First you move notes in proximity, then you (preliminary) name groups.

#### Move in proximity

The easiest way to start a structure, is moving similar data in proximity. You do not need to commit to a group title yet and you can easily try out different ways to organize your data.

Here is a part the analysis where I only moved notes in proximity. Some notes that seem vaguely related to be able to do something:

* I need to find time for cooking and coordinate it with childcare
* Observation: Has a well-outfitted kitchen, with almost all needed appliances.
* “I don’t know how to make a sponge mixture” (she thus buys it ready-made)

Some notes which are, maybe, related to finding recipes:

* Becoming bored by food, trying to find new recipes
* Kids do not like mushrooms, I need to consider this when planning meals
* I collect recipes on Pizza dough; this is currently my favorite
* Observation: Has Recipes bookmarked in the cook book.

Moving notes in proximity can help you to experiment with different structures. When you do this, you might get more confident in some of these structures, and you can give them a title by stating the insight related to the group.

#### State insights

When you clustered some notes together, you can try to find a title for the group. Again, this can be changed later and mainly serves to organize the data and support your thinking.

Reading your notes and annotations might also spark a possible insight without forming a group first. This is great, too. Just write it down and assign the data to it. Even if you have only one or two pieces of data that fit the insight, don’t worry, just see if you find more data that matches and strengthens the insight. If not, you can still revise the title or just get rid of the group and see where else the data might fit.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->
For example, these were my first group titles when structuring the data on learning and recipe use:

* customizing recipes
* learning new things
  * learning new things with video
* prerequisites
  * things
  * doing
* remembering recipes
  * digital
  * analog
* how people choose recipes
* misc (So far I just put all the notes that did not seem to fit well in a large “misc” group)
<!-- EXAMPLE-END -->

When you analyze together with others, try to review what you have so far. It is important that you have a common understanding of the existing structure. This does ensure that the results do not fall apart into per-person subsections.

Now, you will have some preliminary, data-based themes, each created based on a few data points. Next, try if these themes are useful for organizing more than just a few data points.

### Fill the structure

Now you need to see if the structure you created is feasible. While you started creating the first structure with only a part of your data, you now use all of it and try sorting it into the themes. You do this the same way you created the initial structure: Move data in proximity, add it to groups, give groups titles or revise existing ones. The titles you write are ideally insights about the underlying data but if that does not work yet, just go with “same-things-mentioned”-group titles.

If the previous step was building a (data-based) scaffold, now we try to build the actual walls.

![Build upon your preliminary structure to see if the idea actually works.](images/04_analysis_houseWalls.jpg){#houseWalls alt="A house made of toy bricks. There are now solid walls, but no roof yet."}

Aim for 3 to 10 pieces of data per theme. While it is temporarily OK to have very small groups, at the end, each theme should be derived from several data points and not on a single utterance. This does not mean that more is always better: If a theme encompasses more than 10 utterances or observations, consider if it makes sense to split the group in “sub-themes”.

Usually, I would go chronologically through all my notes starting with the first participant and ending with the most recent one—though any other scheme will suffice as well. Just be sure that you know with which data you dealt with already and with which you did not.

When filling the data in the structure, you may notice that you need to create additional themes. Some titles of the themes may need to be renamed as well. Just go ahead and make these changes, if you feel they are needed.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->
For example, a group that I could create early from my data was “customizing recipes”. I started to add some notes:

* This is too few \[oil\]. I rather add some more oil, here, 
* I added some lemon zest, as I like the fresh taste
* It’s fun to change the recipe up a bit!

This is a good start, but I need to test the structure and improve it. There are some points that should be tackled. From the participant codes, I could see that the notes in “not following recipes” were just from one person for now. To see if the group holds up beyond my initial intuition, I need to see if there are other notes from other research sessions.

When reading more notes, I find that there are not many notes that match “customizing recipes” in the sense of deliberately adding or swapping ingredients: These were mostly from just one participant. But there are quite some notes on research with other participants that are on customizing recipes in the sense of not doing exactly what is written in the recipes, like:

* I did not have shallots, but I used onions.
* It also tastes well when I do not wait for two hours.

I added these notes to the group “customizing recipes”. However, these notes were often more about finding good compromises regarding available ingredients or preferences in diet. I renamed the group to “changing recipes” though, which I found more fitting than “customizing”.

Now, your groups will be informed by several data points each. But there will be many themes, which are created by the “same things mentioned”-Method; they don’t state insights. In addition, there might be overlapping themes and groups encompassing many data points, while other groups may be only informed by few data points from just one participant. It is time to revise the structure.

### Revise the structure

After you went through your data and sorted it into themes, take a step back and review your results. 

![Iterate on structures to find a way that works well in practice—this also means removing or rebuilding some parts.](images/04_analysis_houseRevise.jpg){#houseRevise alt="A house made of toy bricks. Some walls are partly removed to rebuild them in a more suitable place."}

If you analyze collaboratively, block some time for a review and collect a list of what is hard and what works well so far. With this list, you can tackle the problems together.

If you recently dealt with just a particular part of the analysis (like working on two particular themes), your view might be too narrow: Glance over the whole range of clustered data, and rediscover themes, which might be a better fit for some data.

Take a look at the themes in relation to the data they encompass: Is there a fit or did you fall prey to wishful thinking? Possibly, there is actually only a weak match between the stated theme and the data. If this is the case, revise your structure.

> _Tip:_ While you create the structure of your analysis, you will look at your notes, images, and diagrams again and again. Sometimes, you have data that is very helpful and expressive; a quote that expresses an insight very well or a photo that illustrates a problem. This data is not only useful for analysis, but also later when presenting your results. You can use it to illustrate how your insight are grounded in concrete observations. When you come across such data, it is useful later to store copies in a separate location for later use when preparing the research report.

There are several typical activities when revising the structure of your analysis: Finding better names for groups, moving data to other groups and creating sub-groups.

#### Find better titles for your themes

Groups based on commonalities or vague similarity will hopefully evolve into insights about the participants. To achieve this, try to revise group titles: make them more concise, clear and meaningful. If you named a theme based on mere commonalities of the data in that group, try to state an actual insight for that group.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->
In my analysis, I had a group that I called “recipe reading”, which contained notes like:

* Looks up how much flour needs to be added.
* Does proceed with next step without reading again.
* Reading recipes before deciding what to cook.
* Read recipe when needed.

A more precise title might be “Participants read recipes occasionally/only when needed”. It was a bit unwieldy, but it described an interesting point: Instead of following recipes like an algorithm, they served more as an occasionally used prop.

This new group title did not match all notes anymore, though. I removed “Reading recipes before deciding what to cook” and put it into a temporary “misc” group. Later, I added this note to the “picking recipes” theme.
<!-- EXAMPLE-END -->

Renaming groups usually requires moving some data between groups in order to accommodate the data to the improved structure, which I discuss in the next section.

#### Move data to other groups

When improving your structure, it might be necessary to remove pieces of data from groups, either moving the data to a temporary “misc” group or to another, more suitable group.

While you should try to use the data you have, it is most important to create sound and helpful themes based on the data—instead of just putting everything under a label.

It is possible, that you can state an insight more clearly by rewriting the group’s title, but as a result, the clearer title may no longer encompass all data in the group. if this happens, go for clarity of the groups title, even if it means that the theme does not encompass all the data currently subsumed in the group. Take out the data which does not fit the improved title and see if it might fit better to another group. If not, place it in a “not yet grouped” or “misc”-Group. Revise that “misc” group, when you made changes to your structure and see, if you can use the data from that group to enhance other groups.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->
For example, I reviewed a group that I called “Problems”. Initially, I put notes here in which participants described problems as well as fixes to these problems.

* I thought risotto would be nice, but I did not have risotto rice.
* The pizza dough is a bit too cookie-like; I try to improve that.
* I forgot to add the salt (when making yeast-dough), it obviously did not taste great in the end
* Recipes are hard to use with dirty hands—in books as well as on the phone.
* …

The group has served its purpose well and provided me order early in the process. However, it had a rather broad topic and the data was only related by being about any kind of problem. I could have structured the problems in different sub-groups, but I decided to dissolve the group and see if the data fits somewhere else or helps me to create new groups.

I could place the note on not having risotto rice in a group on altering recipes and the reasons for that. It turned out that missing ingredients and their replacement were really common and the note made sense there. The problematic pizza dough got moved to a group that was called “improving ” (Not an ideal title, either!). I was unsure what to do with the note on forgetting the salt. I put this note in a misc section where I placed the notes I was unsure about. It later became part of a group on accidental diversions from recipes. Recipes being hard to read with dirty hands made a lot of sense, particularly if one of the initial product ideas was to provide recipes and instructions. There were two similar notes by other participants in the “Problems” group. For now, I created a new group called “Recipe handling problems”.
<!-- EXAMPLE-END -->

By moving notes to other groups you can put notes where they make the most sense. In many cases this means dissolving old groups and creating new ones. But moving data can also happen without larger restructuring just by moving one or two notes from one group to another because they make more sense there. Another case is not moving data between groups, but getting better structures within groups, which is the topic of the next section.

#### Create sub-groups

Creating sub-groups means bringing structure to notes from within one group by organizing them in sub-groups. The process of developing sub-groups is like in [“Develop a first structure”](#developFirstStructure) but it happens just inside the group: Move similar data in proximity and try to create clear-cut insights, if possible. In this process, you might find a more suitable way to state the theme of the main group, too.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->
Here are the steps I used to break up a large group in my analysis that was called “reasons to improve skills”. It contained notes like grouped notes like these:

* I looked up how to glaze onions after a recipe mentioned it and I did not know how
* The pizza dough is a bit too cookie-like; I try to improve that.
* A friend suggested I stir-fry the vegetables, so I searched for a video explaining it.
* I want to be able to make a mousse au chocolate myself.
* …

As the group grew and grew, it became obvious that it lacked structure.

Going through the notes, I extracted two sub-groups. Notes like “I want to be able to make mousse au chocolate myself” and “The pizza dough is a bit too cookie-like; I try to improve that” went into a sub-group that I called “self-directed improvement”. I later renamed it to “Getting skills to cook a certain dish”, as almost all notes in the group mentioned that participants wanted to create a specific dish themselves.

I created another sub-group with notes like “A friend suggested I stir fry the vegetables, so I tried to learn about that.” and “I looked up how to glaze onions after a recipe mentioned it and I did not know how”. I named these “cooking words” initially, as learning skills was triggered by reading or hearing a term referring to something they could or should do (“Stir fry”, “Glaze”)—but they did not know how. “Cooking word”, however is only understandable in context and to make the group title be understandable on its own, I renamed it to “Learning skill triggered by learning about a special term”

Drawing notes in these sub-groups made the “reasons to improve skills”- group’s content far less unwieldy. Not all notes did fit in the sub-themes, so I kept quite some under the “reasons to improve skills”-group directly, but still, it was far easier to understand now.

When the structure of your analysis gets more and more stable, it is time to wrap up your analysis and give it the final touch.

### Wrapping up your analysis

The steps described above build on each other. But like in other creative tasks, there will be a lot of going back and forth between steps of creating groups, assigning data to them and revising these groups.

This process can take up some time. The analysis may never come to an actual halt, but it will slow down at some point. Continuing to move data may still do minor improvements, but there are no big changes anymore.

![In data analysis, just as in any other creative task, there is no perfect final structure—but one that is useful and up to the task.](images/04_analysis_houseFinished.jpg){#houseFinished alt="A house build from toy bricks. It has a roof terrace with a mini figure on it and a small garden in front with flowers, a tree and a postbox"}

If you research collaboratively, it is good if you explicitly point out that it might make sense to bring the analysis to an end. Co-researchers might intervene and point out problems that need to be fixed before moving on or just point out minor problems for which suggestions would be helpful. When you decide that your analysis work is done, take a moment to pause and to celebrate. This is a huge achievement after a lot of work.

If you used analog sticky notes, don't forget to take photographs of the wall(s) you did your analysis on. Sticky notes might fall down or colleagues might need the space and remove parts of your analysis, so it is good to make a backup, just in case.

<!-- EXAMPLE-START -->

Here is the state of my analysis when I decided to wrap it up:

* People do not stick to recipes
  * Deliberate adjustments (like cooking a vegan version)
  * Spontaneous changes (like swapping ingredients in-action, or adding more of something you like)
  * Accidental changes (like forgetting something)
* People do use recipes only occasionally in the process (parts remembered; looking up after steps)
* Acquire Skills
  * Watching YouTube channels
  * Reading about it
  * Asking friends
* Reasons to improve skills
  * Learning after reading “special cooking word”
  * Knowing a dish and wanting to replicate it
  * No reason, just came across it
* Screen, Print, everything is tricky/sticky in the kitchen!
  * Washing hands
  * It will just get dirty
* Assumed skills and devices
  * Compromises if something is not available
  * Not choosing if something is not available
* Picking Recipes
  * based on ingredients available
  * situation-specific
* Strategies for managing recipes
  * Printing out
  * Just remember/re-search

These are all the groups I created in my analysis. The results could be more concise, having fewer groups concentrating on fewer themes. However, this would probably lead to more abstract insights which would be harder to use in design.

The groups of groups are partly not insights themselves, but titles for collections, like “Reasons to improve skills”. Others are direct insights, like “People do use recipes only occasionally in the process”.

By analyzing your data, you structure what you learned in diagrams, notes, and sketches. This makes the data easier to browse but also helps to construct insights from the data. It builds upon the knowledge that you acquired when interviewing, observing and co-diagramming, yet goes beyond it: Analysis helps you to find non-obvious insights and corroborate or discard initial assumptions. You and your co-researchers now have an in-depth understanding of the data. However, not everyone can participate in the research, so the next step is summarizing and communicating your insights to people who were not part of the research, so they can benefit from your insights, too.

## Summary

* Making sense of your data and analyzing it helps you to learn more than the obvious insights and to critically reflect your initial ideas.
* Finding commonalities and contrasts in data is a basic principle of analysis.
* There is no one correct result of analysis, but your analysis can be plausible or implausible.
* In the beginning, you organize data by surface features of the notes, but over time, you focus on the meaning for the user.
* Prepare your data: Annotate your notes and diagrams by writing down possible interpretations.
* Make sense of diagrams by finding commonalities and summarizing the results in a diagram of your own.
* Make sense of notes by finding possible interpretations, filling and testing your structure and revising it until you find a stable structure.
