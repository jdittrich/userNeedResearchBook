# Research focused on understanding

_This chapter covers:_

* _What qualitative research is about_
* _In which projects you can use qualitative research methods_
* _Why research is not a linear process_

Although I am a user researcher since a while, every research project still brings a lot of surprises. What me and my colleagues want to know seems rather simple in the beginning, yet often turns out to be complex. When chatting about an ongoing research project with my peers, I often find myself telling about something that is surprising to me. Usually it is not the kind of surprise that makes the project more erratic, like stakeholders changing requirements without warning. It is the surprise of “Oh, I did not see it this way, but it makes a lot of sense now”, a better understanding of why (potential) users of a product do what they do.

This book is about methods for understanding people you design for and about communicating what you learned. The methods used for this are interviews, observation and structuring the data into meaningful patterns. Such methods used are also called _qualitative methods_.

There are also research methods that do not focus on directly engaging with people but rather on testing and hypothesis using measurements and statistical analysis. These are often called _quantitative methods_. A typical example for quantitative research might be A/B testing: In AB testing, two versions of an interface are compared by measuring which of the versions might, for example, generate more clicks.

In this case, I recommend getting Jeff Sauro and James R. Lewis’ book [“Quantifying the User Experience”]( http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957731269). If you then crave yet more math and complex methods, try Andy Field’s [“Discovering Statistics”](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1290244477) and his [“How to Design and Report Experiments”](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961100072).

Qualitative research is very helpful to get a holistic understanding of how a future product could be used. It is good to find out how motivations, activities, and problems lead to people doing what they do. For example, when people cook, it might be plausible to assume that:

* They decide what to eat
* Get a recipe for the meal
* Buy ingredients
* Cook following the recipe
* Eat

But in everyday life, people often don't follow this clear script: It will influence their actions that their kid or spouse prefer another food than them; They might wish for variety; they might see something that they fancy even more than what they initially decided for; they might not trust their cooking skills… If you want to build product that supports people when cooking or shopping groceries, it makes sense to understand how people actually do it. This does not mean that initial ideas or existing knowledge are wrong: Knowledge like “Programming is typing text that makes computers do stuff” or “Cooking is combining different groceries to get a meal” are not _wrong_. Such knowledge is just often not rich enough to develop products based on it.

There are different ways in which such understanding can be helpful for a project. In the following section, I show several typical setups in which qualitative research can help you to develop a product.


## Types of projects you can use qualitative research in {#projectTypes}

It makes sense to understand motivations, activities, and problems of potential users _before_ a lot of time and money has gone into product development. You can do research to understand potential users without having a working product at all and find out what their motivations, activities, and problems are now.

Still, understanding-focused research can also make sense when product development is already on its way, as long as this research can still influence the products further development. Depending on what is already set or not, there are different project types you can use understanding-focused research in.

### Research for open topic exploration

Putting research at the very beginning of a project and having it as the primary driver puts the user needs first and gives you much freedom in your research, allowing you to focus on the user directly. An example would be to explore “Sharing recipes on the web” or “the future of cooking”. If you read case studies about design research led by famous agencies you will read about this type of research. Such projects are not common: Often there are more constraints.

### Research based on an idea for a new product or feature

You want to find out user motivations, activities, and problems that are important to consider when building a product or service. This is the scenario in which I use user need research most often, for example in tasks like “We would like to build an app that allows people to curate recipes and use recipes when cooking”. The research is shaped by the initial idea, but what will be created in the end is not set yet.

### Research based on an overhaul of a product or feature

If a team plans a substantial overhaul of a product, it makes sense to observe how users use the product to find out where needs are not met. A task could be “We provide an app for curating and reading recipes. It has not been updated in several years and we want to increase its use among a younger target group by providing features attractive for them.” The research tasks is rather focussed: What is to be done is already mostly set, but research shall shape the way it is done.

In all of these settings, understanding users can help to shape new products and features. But what the research focuses on, is shaped by the initial goals. These constraints are one important influence on your research project. Another important factor is how you collaborate with others in the research project.

## Researching alone and together

Researchers can collaborate with others in different ways: Researching as a contractor is different from the research as a member of a product team.

All methods in this book work fine if you need to run the research on your own. But researching alone is not a requirement: Research can and should be done collaboratively, distributing both work load and gained knowledge.

The way of collaboration depends on your mode of work. The following are three prototypical models for using the methods taught in this book: Research for _you_, research _for_ a team, and research _with_ a team.

### Research for you

You can research even as a one-person-team—for example, if you are an entrepreneurial developer who wants to create a product yourself. Most entrepreneurial developers talk to others about the challenges they try to solve for their users and using the methods described in this book is similar, yet more rigorous.

Researching by-you, for-you gives a lot of freedom but often has only tight resources and can easily lack structure.

### Research for a team

Research for a team is a typical situation for many research contractors. You develop a research question, usually together with some key representatives of client; do the research; and deliver the results back to your client. Often, people hire contractors because they do not have a researcher in their team, because the workload is too high, or because they want an outsider to bring knowledge into the team. While there is some collaboration, particularly when creating a research question and when delivering the results, you will do a large part of the work by yourself.

### Research with a team

Product development often involves several people and different roles. At least you have a product manager and developers, but you might also have UX designers, UI designers, market analysts, tech writers and many more roles.

Having a common direction and making sense together is important. This is partly provided by communicating what you find out in your research. But even the best reports can fail to give the rich impressions that one has when researching. It can help a lot to involve people directly as co-researchers: You can set them up with some simple tasks and as they learn, give them more responsibilities and help them to bring in their individual skills. The most common way of collaboration for me is people being co-researchers in interviews. They help with taking notes but also get time to ask their own questions depending on their skill and confidence.

## Understanding is a messy process

In qualitative research, you deal with new people and new situations constantly. This means uncertainty and surprises are part of all projects. I experienced that dealing with these uncertainties is one of the biggest challenges for beginners.

University teachers, conference speakers, and agencies often present research as finding clear facts with rigorous methods and execution of research in clear subsequent steps. Such models are very helpful for giving your plans and actions structure, but they are idealized. It is helpful to keep this in mind.

When you do an actual research project, it won’t always follow a clear and linear structure. It will need iterations and adjustments. Don’t think of it as failures to do “good research” when something does not go as planned. It is actually often a good sign to feel the need to adjust plans: It shows that you learned something new and are aware of it. Plan in time for such adjustments. If your research project is only possible if everything runs very smooth, it might be at the risk of going over time and budget. Also, you and the team might not learn a lot of new things as you can only do what you have expected anyway.

## Summary

* The methods discussed in this book focus on understanding and documenting the activities of people to design better products for them
* Research projects can vary in their constraints they put on research: They can be very open and explorative or suggest a solution already
* Research projects can vary in how you collaborate with other roles (or not): You can research for yourself, you can be part of a team you do research for or your can be brought in
* Understanding-focused research methods can be challenging: Be prepared to learn new, surprising things and to adjust your plans
