"Finding" suggests passive/"view from nowhere" researcher. What are alternatives to the "finding" titel?

*Products should not only be usable but also useful. This means they satisfy a need of the people using them. But how do you know what is useful for users of future products? It helps to get to know users’  motivations, activities, and problems by gathering data and finding patterns. This text teaches methods for doing this.*

\

 I found it hard to start with doing research on user needs because some approaches demanded a lot of  theoretical knowledge, while others assumed a large budget for research.
 I try to keep the barriers to doing research low by prioritizing methods that…

* are useful for design projects in business as well as in academia
* work with a small  budget
* are understandable and applicable without a specific (academic) background
 
 I provide examples to make it easy to see how methods are used. More useful than an abstract  definition of methods like “asking open questions” or “clustering themes” is to see how these are put into action when doing research.

This text describes methods and tricks of the trade. They worked for me and I saw them work for others, too. However, they are not a list of rules that guarantee success if followed. Indeed, doing research by always following a prescribed way, no matter what, will lead to useless results since you could not react to whatever new things you find out. See this book as a travel guide ^[This idea, that a book on methods should be treated like a travel guide, is inspired by _Reassembling the Social_ by Bruno Latour, a book on so-called _Actor-Network-Theory_, describing a perspective that  is frequently taken in sociology of science], written by a person who has already traveled a bit. As in a travel guide, it can be helpful to follow the suggestions. But if the path I suggest can’t be walked, just  go around the obstacle. If people give you strange looks, maybe your current situation is one I have yet to experience and where my advice is not helpful. Feel free to adapt to what makes sense in your situation.

Talking about adapting to your needs: This book is open source, which means it is both free-as-in-freedom and free-as-in-free-beer. This means you can not only read it for free, but also change and adapt it (Details are in [the license](#license)) I hope this helps to spread the knowledge and to improve this book together. Let me know of errors you find in it and tell me and others how the book is useful to you. 

## User need research helps you to create more useful products

Without research, assumptions about the user’s activities with current and to-be-created products are often shallow and do not involve the user’s context. They focus on some features being used, but not much more.

 > Let’s say I want to design an app that eases collecting and organizing knowledge snippets and their references to books and websites. The app should be targeted at PhD students. This is surely a great thing to work on—but without research, I would just have some disjointed ideas in my head: It should be more visual than other, similar software and have an efficient add-new-reference function, based on scanning the books barcode, because typing is not much fun… My assumptions about the context of use are very vague: The PhD students would use the application because they need to manage references.

 Instead, when you researched users’ needs, you can easily think of what is important to users in rich and detailed ways, considering intertwined activities, motivations and problems of users. This will be based on data. Furthermore, it will be structured by common patterns of the users’ behavior. Analyzing these patterns makes it easier to see where your research has gaps or potential. It also helps to communicate what you learned to others: You can talk about the patterns and give concrete examples.

> In my research on collecting and organizing references with some students and professors I found several patterns which can guide my ideas for future design. I might consider that disciplines have very different ways of working. Thus, it could make sense to focus to natural scientists, whose literature is mostly digital, or on liberal arts, who are more paper based. Deciding this would give the project focus. It might need more research, though. Nevertheless, even the mathematicians or physicists do not work only digitally: Paper still plays a large role in their knowledge work. Users from every discipline used paper and computer at the same time. They scribbled things down in front of the screen and alternated between printouts and digital representations. Should my product try to get rid of paper by simulating the paper-based parts digitally? Or assume strength in the differences and just bridge the gap between screen and physical world? 
> And we have not even touched finding and using review works, writing a publication, collaborating with other researchers… all this leading to more ideas that can be discarded, build upon or fed back in further research. 

User research will help you to get a data-based, rich and conveyable image of the users motivations, activities and problems. This does help to tackle the right problems and to get new ideas of what could help the users. Without user research, you may also have assumptions about the user, but they can easily be wrong and will often be simplistic. 

## User need research is an iterative process, not a linear one

The process that I describe in this book may seem to be divided into clear steps, each step its own chapter: First you prepare your research, then you gather data, you analyze it, and, at the end, you communicate the results. 

But in contrast to what the linear structure of this book suggests, it is very useful to switch between steps and also go back to previous ones:

* If I talk to three students about eLearning (Step: *Data Gathering*), and two of them mention they use Facebook discussion groups for exchanging on learning tasks with peers, I could specifically recruit additional people (Back to step *Prepare your research*) who could walk me through a few of such groups.
* If I notice in *data analysis*, that I can't make much sense of how students use different media together, I could  schedule a few sessions of listening and observing and focus on how a piece of information (like “the deadline got extended”) travels though different types of media (social networks, chat) and is transformed (maybe to “lets re-schedule the writing session”) in its use (and by that go back to *prepare research*, *data gathering* and *analyzing data*).

User need research is an iterative process. Instead of doing all steps once, one after another, you can go back and forth. This allows using insights from later steps (like analysis) to shape earlier steps (like data gathering).

## User need research is most useful before the product is being built

User needs should be researched in *early* project stages. It is less useful when a lot of time and money has been spent already on building a particular product.

Here are some scenarios in which user need research makes sense:

**There is a broad topic or problem space, but very little is known yet.**  Not being focused on a particular product gives you a lot of freedom. Such projects are not very common, though. A possible task would be to _“find out about people using libraries”_ or even doing research on _“finding and working with information in media”_

**There is an idea for a product or a service.** You want to find out user motivations, activities and problems that are important to consider when building a product or service. This is the scenario in which I use user need research most often. An example task is  _“The library wants to create an app for creating bibliographies. They want to find out what they need to consider for making it a useful product”_

**A product is to be improved or changed.** If a substantial overhaul is planned, it makes sense to observe how the product is used to find out where user needs are unmet. A task could be:  _“The library already provides an app for creating bibliographies since several years. But students complain about it being useless and hard to use. Now, you should find out about the users to help the library to see how version 2.0 should be different.”_

In all these examples, the outcome is not set yet: Your findings could make a difference and shape the outcome. But if the decisions are already made and your results won’t make a difference, don’t do the research: It will be a frustrating experience if even the most interesting results won’t change the project’s determined course.



## Our inquiry concerns the user, not our (future) product

You may be very motivated to start designing your future product now and research based on the product features you have in mind, asking for preferences and evaluate your product ideas with the users. But if you focus on the *product* now, your research findings will be tied that specific product—which may or may not be useful for your users. If you instead focus on the *user*, your findings will be independent of a particular product implementation.

This idea can to be hard to grasp. One reason is that people assume that we ask questions like:

* What do you want?
* How should I design a product for you?

However, I don’t do this: It would not tell me much about the *how* and *why* of their actions—only that they want *something*. 

Sometimes, user need research is also confused with usability testing. In usability testing, you test a product to improve it. Usability testing is not about finding user needs that exists independent of that product.

Paradoxically, we need to *let go* of our focus on *products* to be able to understand the users and to develop products that users need.

## Should you do it?

Before you get started with a reserach project there is a 
 first and very important choice to make: Should you actually do the research? 
 
 There might be good reasons not to, actually. The products of the tech industry to their fair share of harm be it undermining democratic processes, using limited ressources to build more and more devices that need to be replaced all too soon and drive poor people into badly paid gig work while amassing profits for their shareholders. 
 
 But even if you do not work for a big tech company you should be aware that the results of your reseach can have real consequences for real people. Here, it is important to be aware who will be affected when people act upon your research. Some  people might not match your or the clients idea of ‘users’ and thus are often excluded and not heard. Or the research would extract information from them, but the outcome of the research will be worsen their situation. 

These would all be good reasons to  **not** work on a research project.

PROBABLY REMOVE; IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BELONGS TO THE MAIN  CHAPTER
In this book, you can expect to learn easy, approachable, easy-to-learn ways to find user needs. Nevertheless, this text is not a collection of recipes and more like a travel guide through your first projects. 

User need research should be done in early project stages. This way, your research can focus on the and your research can have an impact on the project’s outcome. -->
