_This chapter covers:_

* _Defining what you want to find out in the research project_
* _Writing the questions you want to ask participants_
* _Learning about your research field before going there_
* _Recruiting participants for your research_
* _Preparing research sessions_
* _Preventing to harm participants or yourself_
* _Writing a cheat-sheet_

It would be awesome if you could start with learning from people immediately. But before you meet your research participants, there is some preparation you need to do. It might not be the most glamorous part of being a researcher, but it is crucial to be well-prepared. Planning the research is important for you and your collaborators to get a common understanding of the research goals. The preparation is also useful for learning a bit about the field you are going to do research in. This prepares you for the next step: Finding potential participants and asking them if they would like to participate. As a researcher, you have responsibility for the effects of your research—on society, on participants and on you. Considering these beforehand avoids harm.

A good preparation will enable you to focus on learning from participants when the time comes, because you, your team and your participants will be well set up for the research. A good way to start with your research preparation is getting a clear understanding of what you and stakeholder of the project want to learn.

## What do you want to learn?

The question of what you want to learn has two levels: First, there is the question of what the goal of the research project itself is, _the research project question_. This is the large overarching goal. You will work towards that goal by learning from participants in your research. You will ask them questions. These questions are not overarching, project oriented questions, but questions focused on what the participants do or feel. These are the _research session questions_. Before you work on the questions you ask the participants in the research sessions, you should clarify the overall goal of the research project.

<!-- EXAMPLE: -->
Imagine, you are asked to support a company in finding out more about a business area they potentially want to move in: They currently publish content and recipes for cooking enthusiasts online and in a paper magazine. They would like to explore improving their offers to younger people who might not be cooking enthusiasts yet. You were brought in by their product manager. While your contract outlines the topic you should research, it is not yet clear what exactly you will work on in practice. For this, you create a research project question.

### Writing a research project question

A research project question briefly outlines the question you want to explore in the research project. It is helpful to start your research project with writing a research project question because it helps you to think about your research and communicate it. 

> _Research project question examples_
> 
> * “How and why do students use digital media to learn better for university?”
> * “How and why do people start being Wikipedia editors”
> * “How and why do Developers use Docker images in collaborative software development”

There will be many situations in which your research touches concerns of other people. At least they will be interested in the purpose of your research: Curious colleagues and research participants will like to know what it's about. Telling them your research project question is an efficient way to describe why you do the research. Some people have a stake in your research. They will not only be curious, but want to ensure that your research helps them. This is most obviously the case if you do research for a client but also when you do research as part of a product team in your organization. A clear research project question helps to communicate the project’s goal. It also ensures that everyone understands what the research will be about. 

In the example I use throughout the book, I do research for a client and I have at least one person I should have a shared understanding of the research project question with: The product manager.

The initial task proposal you are approached with might be vague or overly broad. It might be that the initial question is, for example, “We want to find out how to get in younger people” or “Explore, if an app for recipes is right for us”. While these are questions that the client has, they are still focussed on a future product—but a product that does not exist yet, can't be researched, so it makes sense to focus on (potential) users and how and why they do their tasks.


Here are the questions that you should be able to answer before going forward: 

* What are the goals of the research project? What should you help with to learn more about? For example, you might be told the following:
  * “I think we do this to learn how people actually cook in practice”
  * “We thought about using videos in our app since quite some time, but it seemed too costly. I wonder if we find out that we should actually do this”
* What is the context and history of the research project in the organization? For example, you might get the following responses:
  * “There was a discussion if we actually want to move in this field and be more ‘tech’ and have this app.”
  * “According to research we had done so far, a lot of younger people seem to have an interest in learning to cook better. However, most people we cater to are in their 40s to 50s, so I am unsure if it works for us.”

Even in case you do the research for your own project, without a team, it can help to ask these questions yourself and write down the answers.

The research project question should be focused. This can be difficult to archive if many people with different interests are involved. It can alleviate the problem to keep a visible “research interest backlog”, a table of smaller, specific questions and who asked them. This helps to prevent turning the research question in a mere list of interests while showing your appreciation for the input and your intent to get back to them if you learn more.

I already mentioned that initial questions for a research project might be product-focussed rather than focussed on (potential) users. Instead of rejecting the initial product-focus, you transform these initial ideas and used them as a starting point to create a user- and activity-focused research project question:

1. Take your initial ideas for a future market, product, or features.
2. Ask yourself why the product idea would be good for an activity people do.
3. Take the activity from 2. and ask yourself how and why people do this activity.
4. Refine the question.

Here is an example of how it can be done:

1. The initial idea the team wants to explore is “creating an app that offers recipes and, when cooking, teaches cooking skills.”
2. The meaningful activities connected to it can be “Learning new cooking skills when cooking with recipes”
3. Asking how and why I come to “How do people learn new cooking skills when they cook with recipes?”
4.  We can then refine the question a bit. The people we work with might want to focus not on enthusiasts but on people who have less cooking skills yet, assuming that enthusiasts are a more saturated market. So we can refine the research question to: “How do people with low to intermediate existing cooking skills learn new skills when they cook with recipes?”

> _Tip:_  If you work as an embedded researcher in a team or with a client who emphasizes shared responsibilities and participation, you might not just have one person to involve in shaping the research project question, but several. In this case, a research planning workshop might be helpful to gather input and to help the team to gain mutual understanding of their interests.

 The research project question is for aligning, communicating and planning the research project. It is relevant for you and the people you work with, but it is not relevant for your direct work with participants in research sessions. What matters in research sessions are the research session questions.

### Writing research session questions {#researchSessionQuestions}

The research session questions are the questions you want to ask participants, for example “Can you tell me a bit about how you cook?” They can also be invitations you want to give, like “Can you show me some recipes you like to use?” or “can you walk me through your kitchen?” Some of your questions are not voiced at all, you ask them to _yourself_ to guide your attention for example “Are there annotations in the recipes?”

You may have noticed that such questions are not aiming for specific, short answers which are typical for surveys like “How much do you like your Job on a scale from 1(I hate it) to 5 (I love it)?” or “Please name your most frequently used app”. Such surveys are usually analyzed quantitatively. In this book, I focus on understanding how and why people do what they do—qualitative research. This is I show how to ask questions to which you can get in longer and descriptive answers that can teach you new things that you did not know before. Such questions are called _open questions_ because they don’t have a determined (closed) set of answers. Open questions are, for example, “Describe how you started your work today” or “Why did you add sugar to the dough?”

It makes sense to write down your research session questions. This helps you to remember what you want to ask and enables you to review and improve your questions. Writing down the session questions is also useful for collaboration with co-researchers: They might have good ideas what could be asked and collaborating on the questions will help you to better understand the motivations and strengths of your co-researchers.

When I start writing my research session questions, I often structure them along three topics: _Motivations_, _Activities_ and _Problems_. They are relevant for design, and they can be easily remembered with the mnemonic _M-A-P_.

Questions about _motivations_ are concerned with what the participant wants to achieve and what is important for them. Motivations can give you context to what the participants do.

* “What is most annoying about cooking?”
* “Can you tell me why you choose this recipe?”
* “What is a meal that you have not cooked yourself but would be curious about trying?”

Questions about _activities_ are about what the participant dos and how they do it. Activities are the core part of research, it’s where the action is.

* [Invitation] “Shall we start with cooking?”
* [when observing]“How did you decide that the pan is hot enough?”
* “You said you will replace that ingredient—can you tell me more about this?”

Questions about _problems_ are about what gets in the way of what the participant wants to do. They can show opportunities to improve existing design as well as surface activities that are so familiar, that participants don’t think about them—until something gets in the way.

* [question] “What gets in your way when you cook?”
* [observation] Watch out for people abandoning plans and finding new ways."
* [question] “What makes a ‘bad’ recipe?”

The research session questions are flexible and should be treated as a tool for thinking and preparation. Usually, there are more questions than you will be able to get answers on in each single research session.

Your session questions are not static. You should revise them while you learn more about the field. This can happen even before you talk with participants: By talking to experts and doing desk research, you can learn about the field before you go there.

## Get to know the field without going there, yet

Having a basic understanding of the field helps you to interpret what is going on. Otherwise, what you hear and observe can easily seem like an overwhelming amount of new terms, puzzling behaviors, and unspoken expectations. I show you two ways to learn about a field before you go there: Desk research and talking to experts.

### Desk research

_Desk research_ means you can do it from your desk by reading and summarizing reports, books, websites, and so forth. Ideally, you can start with easy-to-grasp introductions. For our example project, you could get some cookbooks for beginners and see how they teach cooking. It might also make sense to watch some videos where people explain cooking techniques to get a feel for how observation might feel like.

Some areas have a lot of “onboarding material” like books, tutorials and brochures—for example parenting or web development. Other areas might lack documentation, for example because the field is strongly professionalized (like being a pilot or a doctor), because some ways of doing things are considered bad practice (like shortcuts to get work done quickly), or because the topic is considered not actually part of the discipline (like managing your finances as a freelance designer).  Particularly for information on what actually happens aside of what is documented, experts might be a good source of information.

### Talk to experts

Although searching the web for information is often quick and easy, talking to an expert can help you to answer specific questions and get tips on what to consider in practice. The difficult part is usually finding an expert one. 

Very often the team you work with already has some connections to experts: A company creating digital design tools will have close contact to some designers, a company producing medial devices will have contact to doctors. Very often you can use these existing connections to reach out to experts who already have an established connection to your team or organization.

If you need to contact the expert without knowing them before, you might be lucky and they talk with you for free. Otherwise, you pay them for their time. What you need to pay varies and some experts are really expensive. But in general, talking to an expert is an efficient way to get an overview of a field and the relevant questions for practitioners.

## Find people who participate in your research

When you have your research questions written and learned about the field you want to research in, it is time to find people who participate in the research sessions. To be able to do this, you need to get in contact with them, ask if they could participate and organize that participation. This is often also called “Recruiting.” You do this by defining criteria that potential participants should meet and by reaching out to them. You also need to set what you can pay participants for their participation. Payment makes finding people easier and your research more fair.

### Define recruiting criteria

You are probably familiar with demographic recruiting criteria like “30-40-year-old male, making more than $60k/year and being interested in technology.” However, your interest is in what people _do_ and the problems they encounter. Demographic criteria are only spuriously related to that. This is why you should describe the potential research participants based on the _activity_ that is part of our research project question.

In my example project, the research project question is “How do people with low to intermediate existing cooking skills learn new skills when they cook with recipes?”, so the activity is “Learning new cooking skills when cooking with recipes.” This is a good start, it could be a bit easier to understand though: “People who want to improve their cooking skills and use recipes” is probably better, since potential participants could more easily relate to it and think: “Seems they are looking for people like me!”

Recruiting your potential research participants based on activities does not mean that you should ignore criteria that are not activities. Age, gender, ethnicity and other criteria have a large influence on how people act. It will make your research more interesting and potentially more equitable if you include potential participants from a wide range of such criteria. You can set criteria for the diversity of the participants your involve in your research.

Concerning my example project, I know that cooking, as a domestic activity, is usually associated with women. I could say, that I want at least a quarter of the participants to not be woman. Similarly, if I would do research with programmers, it is a reasonable guess that many programmers are young, male, and white. Again, I can set criteria to have some participants older than 35, not to be male and not to be white.

Defining your recruiting criteria along activities that are interesting for you ensures that you recruit participants who actually do what you are interested in. While the activities are the primary criterion, demographics are not be ignored: Having a demographically diverse group of people makes it more likely to observe a wider range of ways people go about their activities.

### Where does the research happen?

Research should happen where the participants do the activity you want to learn about. In the example project, I am interested in how participants cook with recipes, so their kitchen would be the place to do the research: There, they can talk about the context and show me what they do. I can experience the context and see how much space they have in their kitchen, how they use space when cooking and where they keep their recipes. Researching at the place where participants do the activities you are interested in, is called a _site visit_.

However, it is not always feasible to do the research at the site of the activity. For example, some workplaces have a strict no-visitors policy. Some audiences are be globally distributed and long flights to each single participant would be very resource-intensive.  In-person site visits also not always the best way to gather data. For example, if almost all relevant interaction happens on a screen, talking and observing via video chat and screen-sharing might give you better opportunities to observe than looking over somebodies shoulder in their office.

Knowing what your research project will be like and where the research is going to happen is helpful when trying to find your participants for the research. You might also learn more about the field and the participants in the process of finding people and adjust the planned setup accordingly.


### Payment and incentives

<!-- Potentially include a section on the assumptions that it is "ethical" to pay nothing or very few. In this case, cite Largent, Emily A, und Holly Fernandez Lynch. 2017. „Paying Research Participants: Regulatory Uncertainty, Conceptual Confusion, and a Path Forward“. Yale journal of health policy, law, and ethics 17 (1): 61–141. --> 

Payment for research (also called _compensation_ or _incentive_) is important for two reasons: It makes participating more attractive to participants and it allows some participants to participate at all, for example if they could not afford to interrupt their usual job for talking to you.

There are several factors influencing what a fair payment is, among them

* Time spent with you, time spent with organizing, time spent traveling.
* Costs of living for the participants: A compensation that is considered barely okay in Swedish city might be considered big in rural India.
* People who are hard to recruit might be swayed by a larger compensation.

To get a starting point, you can use an online calculator, like this one by [ethnio](https://ethn.io/incentives/calculator), that gives you a suggestion for a sum to pay.

Ideally, you should pay your participants in cash as it poses the least restrictions on participants and does not require to be user of a particular service (like using PayPal or having a bank account). It might not be very relevant for research with middle-class people in a western country, but not everyone in the world has a bank account.

However, paying in cash is infeasible for many organizations. It might not be allowed or only be permitted for small amounts. Gift cards or vouchers are a common alternative. Sometimes, pre-paid VISA cards can also be a good choice. If your participants already use a product of yours, you could also reduce their monthly service fees for it or gift them a free upgrade.

People might reject your compensation. In this situation, explain to them that they spend time on your questions and that they are experts in what you want to learn about and that it is only fair for them to be paid. Also, participants might not be allowed to take any compensation, for example because they work for the government. If people reject the compensation or are not allowed to take it, it can be a nice alternative to offer to donate the money instead and let them pick from a list of 5 or so well known charities to choose where the money should go.

If your work is commercial, pay your participants. However, if you do research as a student or for a small NGO you might only have a shoestring budget and people might be supportive of your cause already. If this is the case, I've had good experiences with giving a small gift to people—some premium chocolate bars or the like. The costs are relatively small and participants enjoyed the gift a lot.

### Plan how many participants you need

There are no clear-cut rules about how many participants you need. However, most of my projects have had more than three and less than twenty participants.

If you have done quantitative research in the past, this will seem like a very small number of people. And it is indeed plausible to assume that conducting user research with more participants is generally better in qualitative research, too. However, as long as you do not invest more resources, having more participants would mean you need to shorten each research session, ask fewer questions and skip observing the participants. But you need time with each participant if you want to understand how and why they work the way the do. And for this goal, several sessions in a hurry lead to less useful results than research with one participant done right.

Nevertheless, doing research on only a very few users restricts the range of behavior and opinions that will be reflected in your research. For example, you might not notice that different people have different preferred ways to do an activity. As well, you might not see which patterns are consistent among several people and which vary. 

 My rule-of-thumb is having 3 to 7 participants in each user group. Our user group in our example project would be people who have low to intermediate existing cooking skills and cook with recipes. This means if you want to learn about many groups of people, you also need more participants to cover these different groups. In our example project we focus on people who have low to intermediate existing cooking skills and cook with recipes. This is a rather focused research question. We would need to recruit more people if we would _also_ be interested in people who consider themselves cooking enthusiasts.

When estimating how many participants you need, consider how much time or money you can spend on doing the research. Each additional participant gives you additional data and a broader view on your possible users. However, each research session needs time and adds to the amount of data to be analyzed.

An efficient way of involving the “right” number of participants is doing your research iteratively: start with two or three participants and analyze the data (How this is done is described in the [section on analyzing data](#dataanalysis)). Take a look at the preliminary findings: If the results seem clear and consistent, you may do research with few additional participants to refine and check and to explore details; or, if time is up, leave it the way it is.

If preliminary findings are unclear or contradictory, you _might_ need to involve more participants.

Reasons for the such unsatisfactory results could include the following:

* Your research encompasses different groups of people with different needs—For example, for cooking it might matter if participants are parents who cook for their kids or if they just cook for themselves.
* The topic of your research is too broad—for example, “How and why do people cook” would be very, very broad.
* Even if your research is focused and there is only one group of people involved, the actual patterns just vary.

In all these cases you can involve more participants—but before you do, try to check if you…

* …need to clarify your research topic (to focus your efforts)
* …need to specify the involved groups (to recruit the right participants)

If you come from research based on measurements and statistics, refinement of criteria during research will feel very unusual. We follow a different paradigm because our research is focused on understanding and describing, not on testing a hypothesis. In this case, it is not only fine but advantageous to do our recruiting iteratively. It helps us to collect rich data and making sense of it by building upon past iterations, asking new questions and refining interpretations.

### Recruit with an agency

Recruiting participants with an agency costs money but saves you work. It also means that you give away control over details of the recruiting. You give the agency your recruiting criteria (also known as _screener_), how many participants you need and when you want to do the research sessions. The agency will get back to you and tell you what it will cost and estimate when they will have found your participants.

Agencies usually have databases of possible participants. They filter their databases according your criteria for the wished-for participants and will talk with them to find a time that works for them. The agency gets back to you, usually after a few days and gives you a list of names and times and contact details for the participants.

Every recruiting agency is a bit different, but they will usually tell you what they need—and they can answer your questions if you are uncertain about something.

### Recruit by Yourself

<!-- possibly include: Recruit via social networks. You can but don't just barge in. Be aware that you are a guest in their space. Check with gatekeepers, read community rules (which might explicitly forbid research recruiting) -->

Recruiting by yourself might be needed when you do not have the budget to pay an agency or when it is easier for you to find participants than it is for an agency—for example because you are familiar with the group of people you would recruit your participants from.

Let’s see what needs to happen for people actually joining your research:

1. They know about the possibility of participating in the study.
2. They are motivated to actually participate.

It is motivating for potential participants if the research improves their life: A shopkeeper likely will be interested if you work on making it easier to keep track of bills; neighbors will be motivated to help if you try to make living in the neighborhood better. Another important factor can be being reimbursed for the time and effort.

When you know what you can offer to potential participants, you can write down what participants can expect if they participate. This includes:

* What the research will be about
* How much time it will take to participate
* What the research will be like/what you will do
* Why they might want to participate, including:
  * How the research results might benefit them or others
  * What they get as an incentive

You can use this information to reach out to potential participants.

> After talking to the team you learn that you could recruit potential participants via the company’s website.
> When talking to a web developer in another team, you find out that the company could add a little recruitment-banner to existing content and restrict it to the geographic area you are located in.
>
> So you ask them to add to all recipes of the “Beginner” category a little banner that says:
>
> _Participate in a study on cooking and recipes_
>
> This leads to a page that explains:
>
> _We would like to learn more about how people use smartphones and tablets/iPads for recipes and for learning to cook better. We look for people who do not yet consider themselves cooking enthusiasts—so if you are still learning, it is not only fine with us, but actually helpful! In the research, a member of our product development team would visit you and look over your shoulder while you cook. This would take approximately 1:30h. If you like to participate, please fill out this form: \[contact form\]_


In the previous example, it was easy to reach out to participants because they were already using a product of the company you work for. But sometimes, field access is more difficult than just putting up some notes. Often, this is because you actually don’t know who or where possible participants can be found, and so you can’t ask them directly.

> Here is an example for a scenario in which access to potential participants is more complex: Working with an NGO on using citizen science for environmental protection, you want to find out how people use freely available data on air pollution which is published by the city government. However, you don’t know anyone who does work with such data. You give it a try and post about your research project on Facebook. A friend of yours answers, he happens to know that a local _hackspace_ is hosting a bi-weekly _data for good_-meeting. The friend sends you a link and read the linked page.
> On the page, you find the meeting organizer’s email address on the sub-page with the _data for good_- meeting details. You write an email and ask if you could join the meeting and introduce your project. In parallel, you have also searched the web, and by trying “\[City name] open data” you found out that, some weeks ago, the city has given an award to the best open data project using data the about the city. You could reach out to the staff member who awarded the price. They might be able to refer you to some people who are interested in the topic, since they needed to get in contact with them when advertising the competition for the award.

In the preceding example, I described a step-by-step process of reaching out: In each step, you try to be referred to a next person who is more knowledgeable and familiar with the people you want to do research with. You do this, until you are referred to possible participants.

At each step, you can learn about how to approach the next: If your friend refers you to a meeting of data hackers, that friend can probably also tell you how you should behave and what you should not do. For example, some groups might gladly tell you about their work, but they have rules against recruiting from their members. Implicit rules are also relevant: For the hacker meeting, it might make sense to NOT be wearing a suit. In other places, the smart clothes might be helpful.

Some people who might help you are in a core position to regulate access to potential participants. The ethnographic jargon for them is _gatekeepers_. They can decide to help you and let you through the metaphorical “gate” to your research field and your participants—or they can stop you, if they have reasons to do so. In the preceding example, a gatekeeper could be the person who runs the “data hackers” meetup or the person being responsible for the city’s _open data_ initiative.

If you have found people who like to be your research participants, you can ask them if they know others who might like to participate. This is also called “Snowball sampling”.

In any case, it is useful to consider different ways to get to your participants. If one way fails (for example, friends of friends), you may be successful in another (such as writing a mail to a contact person of a community). In case several approaches work, you get more potential participants. But even more important is that you now have a more diverse set of people, which leads to richer results.

## Invite participants to the research sessions

When you have found people who would like to participate, you can schedule the research sessions with them. If you recruit with an agency, the agency might do this for you, but since there might be varying levels of support from agencies and because you might recruit by yourself, I will lead through the whole process.

### Let participants know what to expect and ask them for their consent

To allow participant’s to decide whether they want to be part of the research session is sharing information about what should expect and what you do with what you learn. This, in many cases is the _informed consent form._ However, treating it as just a form-to-be-signed  hides that consent and the information given for it are a vital part of researcher-participant communication.

You should share relevant information and ask for consent early on. You can send these documents about a week ahead of the research session. This is better than presenting the information and consent form the first time at the beginning of the research session, with the clock ticking and the researcher expecting a “yes” gives the participant little autonomy, although it might suffice legally.

When preparing the document, I try to include the following information:

* What the research is about
* What the research will be used for
* What the research will be like
* If there are any risks that I am aware of
* How much time the research session will take
* What the participant gets in return
* That the participant can ask me at any time if they have questions about the research and a contact to do so
* How they can consent (that is, shall they sign it on paper? Send me a mail?)

In the following example, keep in mind that the right way for your research might look different.


> 
> Hello [Name],
> 
> You said you were interested in participating in a study. My team and I try to learn more about how people use recipes on their smartphones, tablets, or iPads.
The research sessions would happen in your home and take about 60-90min, at a time that is convenient for you to cook at.
> 
> It is very important for me and my colleagues that we do not test you in any way. There are no wrong answers or wrong ways to do things.
>
> There are no known risks of this research, but still: You can stop the research session at any time for any reason. You will still get the reimbursement.
> 
> I will record our conversation, which helps me to focus on our conversation rather than on note-taking. I will only use the recording to supplement my notes. I will be the only one who accesses it.
> 
> What I learn from you will only be used for purposes of research.
You can ask the researcher questions during and before the research session. You can contact them under: researchermail@example.com
> 
> I attached our consent form to this mail. Please fill in the date and sign it with your name and send it back to me.



When signing a paper is not possible—for example because you do the research remotely—you can also ask the participant to send you a mail with the text, “I have read the forms attached” or by having them write their name in a shared document or the like.

With the consent information and form, I also send a short survey.

At the beginning I usually ask which pronouns they prefer. This helps in the research session to address people properly, but is also helpful to represent them faithfully in the research results. You may think that you can guess people’s pronouns correctly from the name they used in a contact mail or from their appearance. But guessing from appearance and getting it wrong can be embarrassing for you and hurtful for the participant and guessing from name has its limits, too. Some names are not clearly gendered, particularly if you research across different languages and cultures. For example, Andrea might signify female gender to you, but people from Italy would expect it to signify male gender. So it is easier to just ask.

> _Asking for pronouns_
> 
> What are your pronouns?
> 
> * He/Him
> * She/Her
> * They/Them
> * Self-describe: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


If having their name used does not create any obvious risks, I also ask how they want to be referred to in the study results. I usually give the choice between, "Pick a name for me" and a free text field for their name with the note that it does not need to be their legal name.

> _Self-defining option for one’s name_
> 
> How would you like to be named when I talk about you in the research?
> 
> * Pick a name for me (pseudonymous)
> * I would like to be named as: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (can be legal name or a nickname or any other name you like to used)

In many cases it can be helpful to check for basic demographic variables too, like age ranges or where they live to ensure that your research does not accidentally exclude certain demographics. What is important here varies with your research topic. When you research in higher education, for example, you might want to ask if a person’s parents have already gone to university; if you research around mobile apps you might want to know how familiar a person is with certain technologies, and so on.

> _Tip:_ Creating surveys, even if they are short, is not easy. If you know people who are experienced at it, ask them to review your questions. If not, you can also find best practices for commonly asked questions online.

### Setting the date and time for the research session

If you recruit via an agency, they will usually do the coordination for you. If not, it is up to you to ensure that participants remember the time and place to meet. The following are some relevant aspects to keep in mind:

* _Being clear about time and date_: Even if it is a bit cumbersome I try to be very clear about time and date—particularly when doing research internationally. I use the day of the week, day, month, and time in my mails or phone calls. If I research internationally, I also mention the time zone I talk about. In a mail, that might look like: _I could meet you on Monday, the 8th of November, 1pm (“Berlin time”/CET)_. Sending a calendar invite is also helpful as the calendar apps usually convert times, and it makes it easy for participants to set a notification.
* _For remote meetings, be clear about the technology used_: Most video chat software runs also in any modern browser, so people do not need to install a special software. Let participants know how they can join the call. If you use a software you are not familiar with, give it a test run first.
* _For real-life-meetings, find out if there are any special requirements_: Places have their own rules in many cases. I usually share what I expect with participants, so they can fill me in if the expectations would not match: “I will come to Big Street 6 and ring the bell for ‘Miller’” and maybe they tell you: “Oh, right, the bell has the name of my flatmate, Nguyen. So ring there.”

Getting clarity on date, time, technology, and place helps you start the research session without problems when time comes. In the next section, I want to cover some less obvious problems. However, they can have dire consequences and it is important to consider them.

## Bad things that can happen—and how to prevent them

Research should yield helpful results, but even more important is that research should not cause harm to you or the participants. Harmful research probably conjures up images of non-consensual experiments in medical research which feels very far removed from the research you are doing. But your research can cause harm as well. By considering possible risks and avoiding or mitigating them, you can research ethically and in a way that does not harm you or participants.

### Preventing harm to participants

As the researcher, you will have experience in doing research and you determine how the research happens. Participants do not have experience in being participants nor can they easily control how the research happens. This makes it important to plan ahead to prevent harm and make the research a good experience for your participants.

Participants should be well-informed and feel prepared before the research, they should have a good experience when they are in the research session with you and there should be a positive outcome for them hereafter. 

#### Fairness

The participant does actual work to help you learn. Not only do they take the time to participate in your research session, keep the time free of other commitments, and take care that they are there in time, they also do share knowledge and skills that often take a long time to acquire and that can not easily be read up on. This work they do should be honored. Paying them is one important aspect of this. Another is to actually use the data well and not do research for research’s sake or because someone said that “more participants are better”. To enable participants to assess whether your research is fair, you need to share with them what the intent of the study is and how you will reimburse them.

#### Participant autonomy

People should freely decide whether they want to be participants in your research and also what they want to share with you and how. This means that you might not get answers to all of your questions or be able to observe everything you like to observe. This is something you need to accept.

#### Participant safety

Much of user need research is not particularly dangerous for body or soul. But there can be research that can cause physical harm indirectly (imagine researching how people navigate in traffic—distractions could lead to accidents) or research topics that are particularly sensitive (for example researching with victims of crime). The concerns for participant autonomy are particularly important here, as people often know when something will cause them harm. However, they might not act on it, to be a “proper research participant.” If you research in fields where there is a likelihood for physical or psychological harm, it makes sense to speak with domain experts, particularly those from the group of potential research participants to get an assessment of your plans.

#### Protection of identity {#protectionIdentity}

There are many reasons why participants do not want to be identifiable. It can be that they just do not want others to know that they are “bad with computers.” It also could be that you observe real workflows that are not exactly like their bosses prescribe them. And for vulnerable populations it might be the case that they have a stigmatized cognition (for example people having schizophrenia) or target of law enforcement (such as illegal immigrants). Thus, the identity of your participants should be protected. This can be archived by not using their usual name but a made up one and by describing your observations in a way that does not give the identity away by context clues.

For example, pseudonymizing research is often a standard procedure: You replace names of the participants with other names to protect their identity. However, being credited and being shown with one’s own name can also be important and a matter of pride for the skilled participants. In many research projects, I thus give people the opportunity to self-define how they want to be referred to in the research reports.

The safety of participants should be your priority. However, do not forget: Research might also carry risks for you as researcher.

### Preventing harm to yourself

Just like the participants, you should not feel uncomfortable during the research. It is fine and professional to avoid research situations that are dangerous or just _feel_ dangerous. Err on the side of caution.

In some situations, it can be safer to research together with another researcher or a colleague who likes to assist you. This way, you so can look out for each other. It is very common to have a main researcher and a note taker, anyway, so it is no unusual setup. It is also fine to arrange to meet at places where you feel safer or to shift a meeting online so that both sides can call from whatever place they feel fine at.

Only a fraction of research touches on topics that are inherently debilitating, but in some projects you might hear sad or shocking stories from participants. For example, if you do research for a hospital you might hear about shocking diagnoses from participants. If you take on such a project, consider whether you are ready for it. It is professional to know one’s limits and pass on it. If you read this book you are probably a beginner and might want to gather research experiences before researching inherently difficult topics. I personally would only take on such projects if I could collaborate with subject-matter-experts, since there would be high risks for me and for participants.

No matter the topic of the research, it is important to take time to process what one learned. If you do the research together with other people, debrief together after the research session and talk about what you learned. Hearing something sad or irritating can happen even around very mundane topics and talking about it helps you to put it into context. Debriefs are also important to simply jog one’s memory and supplement notes without being in a hurry.

### Beyond individual harm: Ethics of project outcome

 Research can be a lot of fun and earn you money. It also can be immensely motivating to be part of creating a new product. Tech industry’s culture is fueled by the idea of being a force for good by creating more efficiency, information, and connections with the technologies it introduces. User research is often part of creating these technologies—and what we enable with our research is also a question of ethics.

The technologies we help to create also might do unjust things more efficiently, they might foster the spread of false and inflammatory information or destroy existing social structures. User research can advance such developments, too: Researching work of low-paid delivery workers to create a more efficient app for a service platform? Research people’s ideas of good social relationships to make them spend more time on social media? Such research can be done perfectly ethical by itself, but its outcomes might not be ethical at all.

 You, too, need to pay your bills and in many cases it won't be possible to do research only and always on projects with which you align 100%. But be aware that technology has social consequences and that your research can be part of building that technology.

## Writing your cheat sheet {#cheatsheet}

A cheat sheet is a little memory aid that you can take with you when you collect data.
What goes into such a sheet? The biggest part will be topics you want to explore and the questions that you want to ask.

> _Recipe use research cheat sheet_
>
> User Code:_______ , Date: ________*
>
> * Tell the reason for research: Learn about how people use their smartphones and tablets when cooking.
> * Tell how the research session will be (asking, listening, observing; 60-90min)
> * Ask to read consent form again and sign if OK
>
> _Intro_
>
> [mutual Introduction]
>
> * “Can you tell me a bit about how and when you cook?”
> * “Can you tell me about your use of recipes?”
> * …


When you write the questions on the cheat sheet, start with the general topics and progress towards more specific ones. This is the order that makes sense in the course of a research session. Nevertheless, that order is only a helpful guess. You will usually deviate a bit (or a lot) from your cheat sheet.

Often, I include some kind of checklist on the top, especially if there are legal matters involved, such as signing a consent form. Thus, I can tick off what we already dealt with and immediately see if I forgot something.

You may wonder about the “User Code” in the preceding example. When I do research, every participant gets an identification code that can be used instead of their name (like “User2”). Later when you publish the research, you want to retract all names and other identifying information. Using such code, you can identify participants without their names. This is useful to keep the participant’s privacy, particularly if you share or discuss preliminary results. If you need to retain the names, you can keep a _separate_ list, matching participant codes and legal names, so you can revert the codes if you need to. An alternative to codes is to ask participants how they want to appear in the (published) research.

The cheat sheet is a tool to support you during the interview and help you along when your mind goes blank for a moment. It is not for ensuring that you ask all questions in the same way and in the same order. Instead of _controlling_ the situation, qualitative research emphasizes _exploring_ the situation. If the participant does or tells something that is new to you, use it to learn and feel free to come up with new questions that are not on the cheat sheet.

## Summary

* Define what you want to learn in the research project by writing your _research project question_.
* Define what you want to learn from participants by writing your _research session questions_.
* Get to know the field before going there by desk research and asking experts.
* Write a cheat-sheet with the questions you want to research, what you want to observe and ask.
* Recruit based on activities, not demographics.
* User need research is in-depth with few participants.
* Pay users for helping you.
* Prevent harm by assessing the risks that the research itself could pose to you and participants as well as the harm a product could do which creation you support with your research.
