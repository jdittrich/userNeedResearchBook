_This chapter covers:_

* _Defining what you want to find out in the research project_
* _Writing the questions you want to ask participants_
* _Learning about your research field before going there_
* _Recruiting participants for your research_
* _Preparing research sessions_
* _Preventing to harm participants or yourself_
* _Writing a cheat-sheet_

It would be awesome if you could start with learning from people immediately. But before you meet your research participants, you need to do some preparation.  It might not be the most glamorous part of being a researcher, but it is crucial to be well-prepared. Planning the research is important for you and your collaborators to get a common understanding of the research goals. The preparation is also useful for learning about the field you are going to do research in. This prepares you for the next step: finding potential participants and asking them if they would like to participate. As a researcher, you are responsible for the impact of your research—on society, on participants and on you. Anticipating this in advance prevents harm.

A good preparation will enable you to focus on learning from participants when the time comes, as you, your team and your participants will be well-prepared for the research. A good way to start with your research preparation is to get a clear understanding of what you and stakeholders of the project want to learn.

## What do you want to learn?

The question of what you want to learn leads to two kind of questions:  _reserach project questions_ and _research session questions_.  _Research project questions_ are about what the goal of the research project itself is. You will work towards that goal by learning from participants in your research. For this, you will ask your participants questions. These are the _research session questions_. They are questions focused on what the participants do or feel. 

Before you work on the _research session questions_ that you ask the participants in the research sessions, you should clarify the overall goal of the research project with your _research project question_ .

<!-- EXAMPLE: -->
Imagine, you are asked to support a company in finding out more about a business area they potentially want to move in: They currently publish content and recipes for cooking enthusiasts online and in a paper magazine. They would like to explore improving their offers to younger people who might not be cooking enthusiasts yet. You were brought in by their product manager. While your contract outlines the topic you should research, it is not yet clear what exactly you will work on in practice. For this, you create a research project question.

### Writing a research project question

A research project question briefly outlines the question you want to explore in the research project. It is helpful to start your research project by writing a research project question as it will help you to think about your research and communicate it. 

> _Research project question examples_
> 
> * “How and why do students use digital media to learn better?”
> * “How and why do people become Wikipedia editors?”
> * “How and why do developers use Docker images in collaborative software development?”

There will be many situations in which your research touches on other people's concerns. At least they will be interested in the purpose of your research: Curious colleagues and research participants will be happy to know what it's about. Telling them your research project question is an efficient way to describe why you do the research. Some people have a stake in your research. They will not only be curious, but want to ensure that your research helps them. This is most obvious when you're researching for a client, but also when you are researching as part of a product team in your organization. A clear research project question helps to communicate the project’s goal. It also ensures that everyone understands what the research will be about. 

In the example I use throughout the book, I'm researching for a client and I have at least one person with whom I should have a shared understanding of the research project question: The product manager.

The initial task proposal you are approached with might be vague or very broad. For example, the initial question could be “We want to find out how to appeal to younger people” or “Explore, if an app for recipes is right for us”. While these are questions that the client has, they are still focussed on a future product—but a product that does not exist yet, can't be researched, so it makes sense to focus on (potential) users and how and why they do.


Here are the questions you should be able to answer before proceeding: 

* What are the goals of the research project? What do you need to  learn more about? For example, you might be told the following:
  * “I think we do this to learn how people actually cook in practice”
  * “We have been thinking about using videos in our app since quite some time, but it seemed too expensive. I wonder if we will find out that we actually should be doing that.”
* What is the context and history of the research project in the organization? For example, you might get the following responses:
  * “There was a discussion if we actually want to move in this field and be more ‘tech’ and have this app.”
  * “According to research we had done so far, a lot of younger people seem to have an interest in learning to cook better. However, most people we cater to are in their 40s to 50s, so I am unsure if it works for us.”

Even if you are researching for your own project, without a team, it can be helpful to ask yourself these questions  and write down the answers.

The research project question should be focused. This can be difficult to archive when many people with different interests are involved. It can alleviate the problem to keep a visible “research interest backlog”, a table of smaller, specific questions and who asked them. This prevents the research question from becoming a long list of individual questions while showing your appreciation for the contributions as well as your intention answer such questions in case you get answers to them in your research. 

I have already mentioned that initial questions for a research project might be focussed on product rather than on (potential) users. Instead of dismissing the initial product-focus, you transform these initial ideas and use them as a starting point to create a user- and activity-focused research project question:

1. Take the initial idea for a future product (or market, or feature)
2. Ask yourself why the product would be good for an activity people do.
3. Take the activity from 2. and ask yourself how and why people do this activity.
4. Refine the question.

Here is an example:

1. The initial idea the team wants to explore is “creating an app that offers recipes and teaches cooking skills.”
2. The related meaningful activity can be “Learning new cooking skills when cooking with recipes”
3. Asking how and why I got to “How do people learn new cooking skills when cooking from recipes?”
4.  We can then refine the question a bit. The people we work with may not want to focus on enthusiasts but on people who have less cooking skills yet, given that enthusiasts are probably a more saturated market. So we can refine the research question to: “How do people with low to intermediate existing cooking skills learn new skills when cooking from recipes?”

> _Tip:_  In many research projects, you might not just have several people who need to be involved in shaping the research project question. In this case, a research planning workshop might be helpful to gather input and to help the team to gain mutual understanding of their interests.

 The research project question serves to align, communicate and plan the research project. It is relevant to you and the people you work with, but it is not relevant to your direct work with participants in research sessions. What matters in research sessions are the research session questions.


### Writing research session questions {#researchSessionQuestions}

The research session questions are the questions you want to ask participants, for example “Can you tell me about how you cook?” They can also be invitations you want to give, like “Can you show me some recipes you like to use?” or “can you show me around your kitchen?” Some of your questions are not voiced at all, you ask them _yourself_ to guide your attention, for example “Are there annotations in their recipes?”

You may have noticed that such questions such questions don't target specific, short answers typical of surveys, like “How much do you like your Job on a scale from 1(I hate it) to 5 (I love it)?” or “Please name your most frequently used app”. Such surveys are usually analyzed quantitatively. In this book, I focus on understanding how and why people do what they do—qualitative research. I show you how to ask questions to which you can get in longer and descriptive answers. By this, you will learn what you did not know before. Such questions are called _open questions_ because they don’t have a pre-determined (closed) set of answers. Open questions are, for example, “Describe how you started your work today” or “Why did you add sugar to the dough?”

It makes sense to write down your research session questions. This helps you to remember what to ask and allows you to review and improve your questions. Writing down the session questions is also useful for collaborating with with co-researchers: They might have good ideas what could be asked and collaborating on the questions will help you to understand the motivations and strengths of your co-researchers.

When I start writing my research session questions, I often structure them around three themes: _Motivations_, _Activities_ and _Problems_. They are relevant for design, and easy to remember with the mnemonic _M-A-P_.


Questions about _motivations_ are concerned with what the participant wants to achieve and what is important to them. Motivations can give you context to what the participants do.

* “What is the most annoying thing about cooking?”
* “Can you tell me why you chose this recipe?”
* “What is a meal that you have not cooked yourself but would like to try?”

Questions about _activities_ are about what the participant is doing and how they are doing it. Activities are the core of research, this is  where the action takes place.

* \[Invitation\] “Shall we start with cooking?”
* \[while observing\] “How did you know the pan was hot enough?”
* “You said you are going to  replace that ingredient—can you tell me more about that?”

Questions about _problems_ are about what is getting in the way of what the participant wants to do. They can show opportunities to improve existing designs and can surface activities that are so familiar that participants don’t think about them—until something gets in the way.

* [question] “What is getting in your way when you cook?”
* [observation] Watch out for participants abandoning plans and finding new ways.
* [question] “What makes a ‘bad’ recipe?”

The research session questions are flexible and should be treated as a tool for reflection and preparation. There are usually more questions than can get answers to in any single research session.

Your session questions are not static. You should revise them as you learn more about the field. This can be done even before you speak to participants: By speaking with experts and doing desk research, you can learn about the field before you go there.

## Get to know the field without going there, yet

A basic understanding of the field will help you to interpret what is going on. Otherwise, what you hear and observe can easily seem like an overwhelming amount of new terms, puzzling behaviors, and unspoken expectations. I’ll show you two ways to learn about a field before you go there: desk research and talking to experts.

### Desk research

_Desk research_ means you can do it from your desk by reading and summarizing reports, books, websites, and so forth. Ideally, you can start with easy-to-grasp introductions. For our example project, you could get some cookbooks for beginners and see how they teach cooking. It may also be worth watching some videos of people explaining cooking techniques to get a feel for how participant observation might be like.

Some areas have a lot of “onboarding material” like books, tutorials, and brochures—for example parenting or web development. In other areas, documentation might be lacking, for example because the field is highly professionalized (like being a pilot or a medical doctor), because some procedures are considered bad practice (like shortcuts to get work done quickly), or because the topic is considered not actually part of the discipline (like managing your finances as a freelance designer).  Particularly for information on what actually happens aside of what is documented, experts might be a good source of information.

### Talk to experts

Although searching the web for information is often quick and easy, talking to an expert can help you answer specific questions and get tips on what to consider in practice.

Very often the team you work with already has some connections to experts: A company creating digital design tools will have close contact to some designers, a company producing medial devices will have contact to doctors. Very often you can use these existing connections to reach out to experts who already have an established connection to your team or organization.

If you need to contact the expert without knowing them beforehand, you might get lucky and they’ll talk with you for free. Otherwise, you’ll pay them for their time. What you have to pay varies and some experts are really expensive. But in general, talking to an expert is an efficient way to get an overview of a field and the relevant issues for practitioners.

## Find people who participate in your research

Once you have written your research questions and learned about the field you want to research in, it is time to find people who participate in the research sessions. To be able to do this, you need to get in contact with them, ask if they could participate and organize that participation. This is often referred to as “recruiting” research participants. You do this by defining criteria that potential participants should meet and by reaching out to them. You also need to set what you can pay participants for their work. Paying makes it easier to find people and makes your research more fair.

### Define recruiting criteria

You are probably familiar with demographic recruiting criteria like “30-40-year-old male, earning more than $60k/year and being interested in technology.” However, your interest is in what people _do_ and the problems they encounter. Demographic criteria are only spuriously related to that. This is why you should describe the potential research participants based on the _activity_ that is part of our research project question.

In my example project, the research project question is “How do people with low to intermediate existing cooking skills learn new skills when they cook with recipes?”, so the activity is “Learning new cooking skills when cooking with recipes.” This is a good start, it could be a bit easier to understand though: “People who want to improve their cooking skills and use recipes” is probably better, since potential participants could more easily relate to it and think: “Seems they are looking for people like me!”

Recruiting your potential research participants based on activities does not mean that you should ignore criteria that are not activities. Age, gender, ethnicity and other criteria have a large influence on how people act. It will make your research more interesting and potentially more equitable if you include potential participants from a wide range of such criteria. You can set criteria for the diversity of the participants your involve in your research.

In my example project, I know that cooking, as a domestic activity, is usually associated with women. I could say, that I want at least a quarter of the participants to not be woman. Similarly, if I would do research with programmers, it is a reasonable guess that many programmers are young, male, and white. Again, I can set criteria to have some participants older than 35, some non-male, and some non-white.

By defining your recruitment criteria along the activities that are interesting for you ensures that you recruit participants who actually do what you are interested in. While activities are the primary criterion, demographics should not be ignored: Having a demographically diverse group of people makes it more likely to observe a wider range of ways people go about their activities.

### Where does the research happen?

Research should take place where the participants are doing the activity you want to learn about. In the example project, I’m interested in how the participants cook with recipes, so their kitchen would be the place to do the research: There, they can talk about the context and show me what they do. I can experience the context and see how much space they have in their kitchen, how they use the space when cooking and where they keep their recipes. Researching at the place where participants do the activities you are interested in, is called a _site visit_.

However, it is not always feasible to do the research at the site of the activity. For example, some workplaces have a strict no-visitors policy. Some audiences are distributed globally and long flights to each single participant would be very resource-intensive.  In-person site visits also not always the best way to gather data. For example, if almost all relevant interaction happens on a screen, talking and observing via video chat and screen-sharing might give you better opportunities to observe than looking over somebodies shoulder in their office.

Knowing what your research project will be like and where the research is going take place is helpful when trying to find your participants for the research. You may also learn more about the field and the participants in the process of finding people and adjust the planned setup accordingly.


### Payment and incentives

<!-- Potentially include a section on the assumptions that it is "ethical" to pay nothing or very few. In this case, cite Largent, Emily A, und Holly Fernandez Lynch. 2017. „Paying Research Participants: Regulatory Uncertainty, Conceptual Confusion, and a Path Forward“. Yale journal of health policy, law, and ethics 17 (1): 61–141. --> 

Payment for research (also called _compensation_ or _incentive_) is important for two reasons: It makes participating more attractive to participants and allows some participants to participate at all, for example if they could not afford to interrupt their usual job for talking to you.

There are several factors that influence what a fair payment is:

* Time spent with you, time spent with organizing, time spent traveling.
*Living expenses  for the participants: A compensation that is considered just about okay in Swedish city might be considered high in rural India.
* People who are hard to recruit might be swayed by a larger compensation.

As a starting point, you can use an online calculator, like this one by [ethnio](https://ethn.io/incentives/calculator), that gives you a suggestion for a sum to pay.

Ideally, you should pay your participants in cash as this poses the fewest restrictions on participants and does not require being user of a specific service (like using PayPal or having a bank account). It may not be very relevant to research involving middle-class people in a western country, but not everyone in the world has a bank account.

However, paying in cash is infeasible for many organizations. It may not be allowed or only be permitted for very small sums. Gift cards or vouchers are a common alternative. Sometimes, pre-paid VISA cards can also be a good choice. If your participants already use a product of yours, you can also reduce their monthly service fees for it or give them a free upgrade of their plan.

People might reject your compensation. In this situation, explain to them that they spend time on your questions and that they are experts in what you want to learn about and that it is only fair for them to be paid. Participants may not be _allowed_ to take any compensation, for example because they work for the government. If people reject the compensation or are not allowed to take it, it can be a nice alternative to instead offer to donate the money instead and let them choose from a list of well-known charities to choose where the money should go.

> Tip: Sarah Fathallah’s article [“Why Design Researchers Should Compensate Participants”](https://medium.com/notes-off-the-grid/why-design-researchers-should-compensate-participants-a65252352f67) discusses not only the “why” of compensation but also typically raised objections to compensation.

If your work is commercial, pay your participants. However, if you do research as a student or for a small NGO you might only have a very tight budget and people might be supportive of your cause already. If this is the case, I've had good experiences with giving a small gift to people—some premium chocolate bars or the like. The costs are relatively small and participants enjoyed the gift a lot.

### Plan how many participants you need

There are no clear rules as to how many participants you need. However, most of my projects  had more than three and fewer than twenty participants.



If you have done quantitative research in the past, this will seem like a very small number of people. And indeed, it is plausible to assume that user research with more participants is generally better in qualitative research as well.  However, unless you invest more resources, more participants would mean shortening each research session, asking fewer questions and skipping  participant observation. But you need time with each participant if you want to understand how and why they work the way they do. And to this end, several sessions in a hurry yield less useful results than research with one participant done right.

Nevertheless, doing research on only a very few users restricts the range of behaviors and opinions that will be reflected in your research. For example, you may not notice that different people have different preferred ways of doing activity. Also, you may not see which patterns are consistent across several people and which vary. 

 My rule-of-thumb is having 3 to 7 participants in each user group. Our user group in our example project would be people who have low to medium cooking skills and who cook with recipes. This means that if you want to learn about many groups of people, you also need more participants to cover these different groups. Our research question is currently focused on beginners, but we would need to recruit more people if we would _also_ be interested in people who consider themselves cooking enthusiasts.

When estimating how many participants you need, consider how much time or money you can spend on doing the research. Each additional participant gives you additional data and a broader view on your potential users. However, each research session needs time and adds to the amount of data to be analyzed.

An efficient way  to include the “right” number of participants is to do your research iteratively: start with two or three participants and analyze the data (How to do this is described in the [section on analyzing data](#dataanalysis)). Take a look at the preliminary findings: If the results seem clear and consistent, you can do research with a few additional participants to refine and check and to explore details; or, if time is up, leave as it is.

If preliminary findings are unclear or contradictory, you _may_ need to include more participants.

Reasons for the such unsatisfactory results can be:

* The participants  encompass different groups of people with different needs—For example, for cooking it may be important whether participants are parents who cook for their kids or whether they just cook for themselves.
* The topic of your research is too broad—for example, “How and why do people cook” would be very, very broad.
* Even if your research is focused and involves only one single group of participants, the actual patterns may just vary.

In all these cases you can include more participants—but try to check beforehand whether you…

* …need to clarify your research topic (to focus your efforts)
* …need to specify the group(s) involved more clearly (to recruit the right participants)

Coming from research based on measurements and statistics, refinement of criteria during research will feel very unusual or even like cheating. But qualitative research follows a different paradigm. The research I describe here aims at understanding and describing. In this case, it is not only fine but advantageous to do our recruiting iteratively. It helps us to collect rich data and making sense of it by building upon past iterations, asking new questions and refining interpretations.


### Recruit with an agency

Recruiting participants through an agency costs money but saves you work. It also means that you relinquish control of recruiting details. You provide the agency with your recruitment criteria (also known as _screener_), how many participants you need and when you want to conduct the research sessions. The agency will get back to you and tell the cost and an estimate of when they will have found your participants.

Agencies usually have databases of possible participants. They filter their databases according to your criteria for the desired participants and will talk with them to find a time that works for them. The agency will usually get in touch with you after a few days and give you a list of names, times, and contact details of the participants.

Each recruiting agency is a little  different, but they will tell you what they need—and they can answer your questions if you are unsure about something.

### Recruit by Yourself

<!-- possibly include: Recruit via social networks. You can but don't just barge in. Be aware that you are a guest in their space. Check with gatekeepers, read community rules (which might explicitly forbid research recruiting) -->

Recruiting by yourself might be needed when you do not have the budget to pay an agency or when it is easier for you to find participants than it is for an agency—for example because you are familiar with the group of people you would recruit your participants from.

Let’s see what needs to happen for people actually joining your research:

1. They know about the possibility of participating in the study.
2. They are motivated to actually participate.

It is motivating for potential participants when the research improves their life: A shopkeeper will likely be interested if you work on making it easier to keep track of bills; neighbors will be motivated to help when you try to make living in the neighborhood better. Another important factor can be being reimbursed of time and effort.

When you know what you can offer to potential participants, you can write down what they can expect when they participate. This includes:

* What the research will be about
* How much time it will take to participate
* What the research will be like/what you will do
* Why they might want to participate, including:
  * How the research results might benefit them or others
  * What they get as an incentive

You can use this information to reach out to potential participants.

> After speaking to the team you learn that you could recruit potential participants through the company’s website.
> When talking to a web developer in another team, you find out that the company could add a small recruitment-banner to existing content and limit showing it to the geographic area you are located in.
>
> So you ask them to add to all recipes of the “Beginner” category a little banner that says:
>
> _Participate in a study on cooking and recipes_
>
> This leads to a page that says this:
>
> _We would like to learn more about how people use smartphones and tablets/iPads for recipes and for learning to cook better.  We're looking for people who who do not yet consider themselves cooking enthusiasts—so if you are still learning, that’s not only fine with us, but actually helpful! In the research, a member of our product development team would visit you and look over your shoulder while you cook. This would take approximately 1:30h. If you like to participate, please fill out this form: \[contact form\]_


In the previous example, it was easy to reach out to participants because they were already using a product of the company you work for. But sometimes, field access is harder than just putting up some notes or banners. Often, this is because you actually don’t know where to find potential research participants yet. In this case, you first need to do some research to find them.

> Here is an example for a scenario where  accessing potential participants is more complex: Working with an NGO on using citizen science for environmental protection, you want to find out how people use freely available data on air pollution data, published by the city administration. However, you don’t know anyone who does work with such data. You give it a try and post about your research project on Facebook. A friend of yours answers. He happens to know that a local _hackspace_ is hosting a bi-weekly _data for good_-meeting. The friend sends you a link. On the linked page, you find the meeting organizer’s email address. You write them an email and ask if you could join the meeting and introduce your project. 

In the previous example, I outlined a step-by-step process of reaching out: In each step, you try to be referred to a next person who is more knowledgeable and familiar with the people you want to do research with. You do this, until you are referred to possible participants.

At each step, you can learn  how to approach the next one: If your friend refers you to a meeting of data hackers, that friend can probably also tell you how you should present yourself and what you should avoid doing. Implicit rules are also relevant: For the hacker meeting, it might make sense NOT to wear a suit. In other places, the smart clothes might be helpful.

Some people who could help you are in a position that allows them to give or deny you access to potential participants. The ethnographic jargon for them is _gatekeepers_. They can decide to help you and let you through the metaphorical “gate” to your research field and your participants—or they can stop you, if they have reasons to do so. In the preceding example, a gatekeeper could be the person who runs the “data hackers” meetup or the person being responsible for the city’s _open data_ initiative.

Once you have found people who would like to be your research participants, you can ask them if they know others who would also like to participate. This is also called “snowball sampling”.

In any case, it is useful to consider different ways to get to your participants. If one way fails (for example, friends of friends), you may be successful in another (such as writing a mail to a contact person of a community). In case several approaches work, you get more potential participants. But more importantly, you now have a more diverse group of people, leading to richer results.

## Invite participants to the research sessions

When you have found people who want to participate, you can schedule the research sessions with them. If you are recruiting with an agency, the agency can do this for you, but since there are varying levels of support from agencies and because you may be recruiting by yourself, I will guide you through the whole process.

### Let participants know what to expect and ask for their consent

To help attendees decide whether to participate in the research session, share information about what to expect and what you're going to do with what you've learned. 
After the participants are informed about the project, they can decide to give their consent by signing a consent form. 

 However, treating it as just a form-to-be-signed hides that consent and the information given for it are a vital part of the communication between researcher and participant. You should shape the process of informed consent so that the participant is always in charge.

You should share relevant information and ask for consent early on. For examples, you can send the information about your project and the consent form a week ahead of the research session. This is better than presenting the information and consent form the first time at the beginning of the research session, with the clock ticking and the researcher expecting a “yes” gives the participant little autonomy, although it might suffice legally.

When preparing the information about the research project, I usually include the following information:

* What the research is about
* What the research will be used for
* What the research will be like
* If there are any risks that I am aware of
* How much time the research session will take
* What the participant gets in return
* That the participant can ask me at any time if they have questions about the research and a contact to do so
* How they can consent (that is, should they sign it on paper? Send me a mail?)

In the following example, keep in mind that the correct way for your research may look different.

> 
> Hello [Name],
> 
> You said you were interested in taking part in a study. My team and I are trying to learn more about how people use recipes on their smartphones, tablets, or iPads.
The research sessions would take place in your home and take about 60-90min, at a time when you will cook.
> 
> It is very important to me and my colleagues that we do not test you in any way. There are no wrong answers or wrong approaches.
>
> There are no known risks of this research, but still: You can end the research session at any time without giving a reason. You will still get the compensation.
> 
> I will record our conversation, which will help me to focus on our conversation instead of taking notes. I will only use the recording to supplement my notes. I will be the only one accessing the recording.
> 
> What I learn from you will only be used to improve our products and nowhere else.
You can ask the researcher questions during and before the research session. You can contact them under: researchermail@example.com
> 
> I have attached our consent form to this email. Please fill in the date and sign it with your name and send it back to me.

If signing a paper is not possible—for example because you are doing  the research remotely—you can also ask the participant to send you a email with the text, “I have read the forms attached” or by having them write their name in a shared document or something like that.

With the consent information and form, I also send out a short survey.

At the beginning I usually ask which pronouns they prefer. This helps in the research session to address people properly and to represent them faithfully in the research results. You may think that you can guess people’s pronouns correctly from the name they used in a contact mail or from their appearance. But guessing by looks and getting it wrong can be embarrassing for you and hurtful for the participant, and guessing from name has its limits, too. Some names are not clearly gendered, particularly if you research across different languages and cultures. For example, Andrea might signify female gender to you, but people from Italy would expect it to signify male gender. So it is easier to just ask.

> _Asking for pronouns_
> 
> What are your pronouns?
> 
> * He/Him
> * She/Her
> * They/Them
> * Self-describe: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


If there is no obvious risk associated with the research,  I also ask how they want to be referred to in the study results. I usually give the choice between “Pick a name for me” and a free text field for their name with the note that it does not need to be their legal name. 

> _Self-defining option for one’s name_
> 
> How would you like to be named when I talk about you in the research?
> 
> * Pick a name for me (pseudonymous)
> * I would like to be named as: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (can be legal name or a nickname or any other name you like to used)

In many cases, it can be helpful to check for basic demographic variables too, like age ranges or where they live to ensure that your research is not  accidentally excluding certain demographics. What is important here depends on your research topic. When you research in higher education, for example, you might want to ask if a person’s parents have already attended college; if you research around mobile apps you might want to know how familiar a person is with certain technologies, and so on.

> _Tip:_ Creating surveys, even if they are short, is not easy. If you know people who have experience with this, ask them to review your questions. If not, you can find best practices online that demonstrate established ways to ask commonly used questions. 

### Setting the date and time for the research session

If you recruit through an agency, they will usually take care of the coordination for you. If not, it is up to you to ensure that participants remember the time and place to meet. The following are some relevant aspects to keep in mind:

* _Be clear about time and date_: Even if it is a bit awkward I try to be very clear about time and date.  I mention the day of the week, day, month, and time in my mails or phone calls. If I research internationally, I also mention the time zone I talk about. In an email, that might look like: _I could meet you on Monday, the 8th of November, 1pm (“Berlin time”/CET)_. Sending a calendar invite is also helpful as the calendar apps usually convert times, and it makes it easy for participants to set a notification.
* _For remote meetings, be clear about the technology used_: Most video chat software runs also in any modern browser, so people do not need to install a special software. Let participants know how they can join the call. If you use a software you are not familiar with, give it a test run first.
* _For real-life-meetings, find out if there are any special requirements_: Places have their own rules in many cases. I usually share what I expect with participants, so they can fill me in if the expectations would not match: “I will come to Big Street 6 and ring the bell for ‘Miller’” and maybe they tell you: “Oh, right, the bell has the name of my flatmate, Nguyen. So ring there.”

Getting clarity on date, time, technology, and place helps you start the research session without problems when time comes. In the next section, I want to cover some less obvious problems. However, they can have dire consequences and it is important to consider them.

## Bad things that can happen—and how to prevent them

Research should yield helpful results, but even more importantly, it should not cause harm to you or the participants. “Harmful research” probably conjures up images of non-consensual experiments in medical research which feels very far distant from the research you are doing. But your research can also cause harm. By considering possible risks and avoiding or mitigating them, you can research ethically and in a way that does not harm you nor the participants.

### Preventing harm to participants

As a researcher, have experience in doing research and you can determine how you carry out the research. Participants have no experience in being participants nor can they easily control how the research is conducted. This makes it important for you to plan ahead to prevent harm and make the research a good experience for your participants.

Participants should be well-informed and feel prepared before the research, they should have a good experience when they are in the research session with you and there should be a positive outcome for them afterwards. 

#### Fairness

The participant does actual work to help you learn. They take time to participate in your research, keep that time free of other commitments, take care that they are there on time and last, but not least, they also do share knowledge and skills that often take a long time to acquire. This work they do should be honored. Paying them is one important aspect of this. Another is to use the data well and not do research for research’s sake or because someone said that “more participants are better”. In order for participants to judge whether your research is fair for them, you need to share what the purpose of the study is and how you will reimburse them.

#### Participant autonomy

People should be free to choose to participate in your research and also what to share with you and how. This means that you may not get answers to all of your questions or may not observe everything you like to observe. You have to accept that.

#### Participant safety

Much of user need research is not particularly dangerous for body or soul. But there may be research that can cause physical harm indirectly (imagine researching how people navigate in traffic—distractions could lead to accidents) or research topics that are particularly sensitive (for example, researching with victims of crime). The concerns for participant autonomy are particularly important here, as people often know when something will cause them harm. However, they might not act on it in order to be a “proper research participant.” If you research in fields where  physical or psychological harm is a possibility, it makes sense to speak with domain experts, particularly those from the group of potential research participants to get an assessment of your plans.

#### Protection of identity {#protectionIdentity}

There are many reasons why participants do not want to be identifiable. They may just do not want others to know that they are “bad at computers.” It also could be that you observe real work processes that are not exactly like their bosses dictate. And for vulnerable populations it might be the case that they have a stigmatized cognition (for example people having schizophrenia) or target of law enforcement (such as illegal immigrants). Thus, the identity of your participants should be protected. This can be archived by not using their usual name but a made-up one and by describing your observations in a way that context clues do not reveal their identity.

For example, pseudonymizing research is a standard procedure: You replace names of the participants with other names to protect their identity. However, being credited and being shown with one’s own name can also be important and a matter of pride for the skilled participants. In many research projects, I thus give people the opportunity to self-define how they want to be referred to in the research reports.

The safety of participants is essential. However, do not forget: Research might also carry risks for you as researcher.

### Preventing harm to yourself

Just like the participants, you should not feel uncomfortable during the research. It is okay and professional to avoid research situations that are dangerous or just _feel_ dangerous. Err on the side of caution.

In some situations, it may be safer to research together with another researcher or a colleague who likes to assist you. This way, you so can look out for each other. It is very common to have a main researcher and a note taker, anyway. It is also fine to arrange to meet at places where you feel safer or to shift a meeting online so that both sides can call from whatever place they feel fine at.

Only a fraction of research topics are inherently debilitating, but in some projects you might hear sad or shocking stories from participants. For example, if you are researching for a hospital you might hear about shocking diagnoses from participants. If you take on such a project, consider whether you are ready for it. It is professional to know your limits to refuse the job. If you are reading this book, you are probably a beginner in user research and may want to gather research experiences before researching inherently difficult topics. Personally, I would only take on such projects if I could collaborate with subject-matter-experts, since there would be high risks for me and the participants.

Regardless of the topic of the research, it is important to take the time to process what you have learned. If you are conducting the research with other people, do a joint  debrief after the research session and talk about what you learned. Hearing something sad or irritating can happen even with very mundane topics. Talking about it helps you to put it into context. Debriefs are also important to simply jog one’s memory and supplement notes without haste.

### Beyond individual harm: Ethics of project outcome

 Research can be a lot of fun and make you money. It can also be immensely motivating to be involved in the development of a new product. The culture of the tech industry is driven by the idea of being a force for good by creating greater efficiency, information, and connections with the technologies it introduces. User research is often part of creating these technologies—and what we enable with our research is also a question of ethics.

The technologies we help to develop also might do unjust things more efficiently, they might encourage the spread of false and inflammatory information or destroy existing social fabrics. User research can advance such developments, too: Researching work of low-paid delivery workers to create a more efficient app for a service platform? Research people’s ideas of good social relationships to make them spend more time on social media? Such research can be done perfectly ethical by itself, but its outcomes might not be ethical at all.

 You too have to pay your bills and in many cases it will not be possible only and always research on projects you are 100% aligned with. But be aware that technology has social consequences and that your research can be part of building that technology.

## Write your cheat sheet {#cheatsheet}

A cheat sheet is a little memory aid that you can take with you when you collect data.
Most of the cheat sheet will be topics you want to explore and the questions that you want to ask.

> _Recipe use research cheat sheet_
>
> User Code:_______ , Date: ________
>
> * Tell the reason for research: Learn about how people use their smartphones and tablets when cooking.
> * Tell how the research session will be (asking, listening, observing; 60-90min)
> * Ask to read consent form again and sign if OK
>
> _Intro_
>
> [mutual Introduction]
>
> * “Can you tell me a bit about how and when you cook?”
> * “Can you tell me about your use of recipes?”
> * …


When writing the questions, start with the general topics and progress towards more specific ones. This is the order that makes sense over the course of a research session. Nevertheless, the sequence of questions is just  a helpful guess. You will usually deviate a little (or a lot) from your cheat sheet.

I often include a checklist on the top, especially when it comes to legal matters, such as signing a consent form. That way, I can check off what I have already done see immediately if I have forgotten anything.

You may be wondering about the “User Code” in the previous example. When I do research, I give every participant an identification code that can be used in place of their name (like “User2”). Later, when you publish the research, you want to retract all names and other identifying information. Such code allows you to identify participants without their names. This is useful for maintaining participant privacy. If you need to keep the names, you can keep a _separate_ list that matches participant codes and legal names. This way, you can revert the codes if necessary. An alternative to codes is to ask participants how they would like to appear in the (published) research.

The cheat sheet is a tool that will support you during the interview and help you when your mind goes blank for a moment. It is not intended to ensure that you ask all questions in the same manner and in the same order. Rather than _controlling_ the situation, qualitative research emphasizes _exploring_ the situation. If the participant does or says something that is new to you, use it to learn and feel free to come up with new questions that are not on the cheat sheet.

## Summary

* Define what you want to learn in the research project by formulating your _research project question_.
* Define what you want to learn from participants by writing your _research session questions_.
* Get to know the field before you go there by desk research and asking experts.
* Recruit based on activities, not demographics.
* User need research is in-depth, with few participants.
* Pay users for helping you.
* Prevent harm by assessing the risks the research itself could pose to you and participants as well as the harm a product your research is helping to create could do.
* Write a cheat-sheet with the questions you want to research, what you want to observe and ask.
