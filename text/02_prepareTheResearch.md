# Prepare your research

## Create a user-focused how-and-why question based on the initial idea for the project {#questiontopics}

It can help a lot to have a guiding question when you start your research. This question should relate to how and why your (potential) users do what they do. You might already have an idea for a future service, product or feature. You can use such ideas as a starting point for creating a useful, user-focused research question. Here is how you do this: 

1. Take your initial ideas for a future market, product or features
2. Ask yourself why the product idea would be good for an activity people do. 
3. Take the activity from 2. and Ask, _how_ and _why_ people do this. The outcome can be used as research question.

> 
> Here is an example:
>
> 1. The initial idea is _“build a learning platform for university students”_
> 2 The meaningful activity connected to it can be _“using digital media to learn better for university”_
> * Asking _how_ and _why_ I come to _“How and why do students use computers to learn better for university?”_
> 
> I then refined the question a bit, since _“to learn better”_ is often understood as remembering facts or passing exams. Also, _“use computers”_ sounded like I am not interested e.g. in smartphones or use of social networks. In the end, I used _“How and why do students use digital media related to their studies”_.


The research question is a help for you to ask more focused questions and to communicate your aims. It does not need to be the _one true question_. Thus, it can also be refined later after you gained a better understanding of the matter.

## Find participants

In user research you want to find out what our users do and how and why they do it. If you know this, you can design our products accordingly.

To be able to do research on the “how” and “why” of users’ work, you need to find people who would like to answer your questions and would show you what they do. These people are our (research) *participants*.

### Potential participants do the activity that is in your research question

Research participants should be able to talk about what they do and demonstrate it. Because of this, it makes sense to focus on activities when you recruit.

Demographics are not very useful: “30-40-year-old male, making more than $50k/year and being interested in technology” does not relate much to motivations, activities and problems of users. Instead of using demographics, base your recruiting on the activity that is part of your research question:


* If you have the research question *“How and why do students use computers to learn for university?”* the activity is “learning for university”. This is what you should focus on: Find people, who learn for university.

* If your question is “How and why do small business owners keep track of their bills?”, the activity is “keeping track of bills”, additionally constraint by the role: “Small business owners”.

I don't exclude the roles (“Student”, “Owner of a small business”), but I focus on the activities first. In the question “How and why do small business owners keep track of their bills”, the essential part is keeping track of bills. This is also what people can tell you about and what they can demonstrate. If I talk to an owner of a small business and they do not take care of the bills themselves, I would ask why they do so and who is doing it instead—and then ask whoever is doing the “keeping track of bills”-activity if they want to participate.

### Let potential participants know about your research and why they should take part

<!-- ↑ that could be better, but even my german sentences are not great: …wo sie sind?! -->
 
There are two ways to get participants: 

1. The easy way is paying a recruiting agency. They will get your participants according to criteria you give them.
2. The harder way is doing the recruiting yourself, and this is what I will be explaining.

Recruiting yourself, obviously, might be needed since you do not have the budget to pay an agency. Sometimes it can also be easier for you to get specific participants than for the agency. 

Two conditions need to be satisfied for people to take part in your research: 

1. They know about the possibility of participating in the study 
2. they are motivated to actually participate

It is motivating for potential participants if the research improves their life: A shopkeeper will likely be interested if you work on making it easier to keep track of bills, neighbors will be motivated to help if you try to make living in the neighborhood better.

Incentives, like money or vouchers, are a simple, but effective motivation for participants. If you have the funds and, particularly, if your project will earn you (or your employer) money, you should pay for your participants’ time. If your funds are small and people like to support you and your cause, you could also offer something that people like, but would usually not “just” buy, e.g. really good chocolate or a voucher for a nice local restaurant. Such things are far more valued than the money they cost.

When you know what you can offer to potential participants, you can write down what participants can expect if they participate. This includes:

* What the research will be about
* How much time it will take to participate
* What the research will be like/what you will do
* Why they might want to participate, including
    * How the research results might benefit them and/or others
    * What they get as an incentive

You can use this information to create paper notes or posts to social media—This is how it could look like as a slightly formal note for a notice board at university:


> Are you using the university’s library?
> 
> The university library would like to improve the LibApp to support you better in using our library and digital services. Therefore, we would like to gather some insights into the way you work in the library and with our services.
> If you would like to support us, someone from our team ask you some questions and look over your shoulder while you work. This would take approximately 1h and take place in the library or some other place where you use our services from. 
> All participants get a $10 voucher for the university’s cafeteria. If you would like to participate (or have further questions) please write an email to jan.dittrich@example.com 

In some cases, finding participants is easy, because participants are motivated and you can easily reach out to them, as in this example: 

> If you have the task to find out how the library’s services could be improved, you can reach out to potential participants by using the library’s notice board. 
> You can also ask the “how-to-use-the-library” trainers to mention the project. 
> Students might even be motivated enough to just join out of interest and because they want to contribute to improving their own life—but it is only fair if 
> the library pays them for their time 
> (and it might also help to represent students who struggle with money and would otherwise work in the time).

In above example, it was easy to reach out to participants because you were already close to them, spatially as well as socially. But sometimes, field access is more difficult than just putting up some notes. Often, this is because you actually don’t know who or where possible participants can be found, and so you can’t ask them. This means you need to get to them in a step-by-step process. The following example outlines this: 

> You want to find out how people use freely available data on air pollution which is published by cities. But you don’t know anyone who does work with such data. You give it a try and post about your research project on Facebook. You are lucky, and a friend of yours happens to know that a local “hackspace” is hosting a bi-weekly “data hackers meeting”. You click on the link your friend send you and read the linked page. You find the meeting organizer’s email address on the sub-page with the “data hackers meeting” details. You write an email and ask if you could join the meeting and introduce your project.
> In parallel, you have also searched the web, and by trying “[next largest city] open data” you found out that, some weeks ago, the infrastructure department of the city has given an award to the best open data project using data the about the city. You could reach out to the staff member who awarded the price. They might be able to refer you to some people who are interested in the topic, since they needed to get in contact with them when advertising the competition for the award.

In the scenario above, I described a step-by-step process of reaching out: In each step, you try to be referred to a next person who is more knowledgeable and familiar with the people you want to do research with. You do this, until you are referred to possible participants. 

At each step, you can learn about how to approach the next: If your friend refers you to a meeting of data hackers, that friend can probably also tell you if you should behave in a particular way if you are going there. For the hacker meeting, it might make sense to NOT be wearing a suit. In other places, the smart clothes might be essential.

Some people who might help you are in a core position to regulate access to potential participants. The ethnographic jargon for them is “Gatekeepers”. They can decide to help you and let you through the metaphorical “gate” to your research field and your participants—or they can hinder your access, if they have reasons to do so. In the example above, a gatekeeper could be the person who runs the “data hackers”-meetup or the person being responsible for the city’s “open data”-initiative.

If you have found people who like to be your research participants, you can ask them if they know others who might like to participate. It works like the step-by-step recruiting process, but instead of moving towards your participants, you now can go from one to another by being referred. 

In any case, it is useful to consider different ways to get to your participants. If one way fails (e.g. friends of friends), you may be successful in another (e.g. writing a mail to a “gatekeeper”). In case several approaches work, you get more potential participants. But even more important is that you now have a more diverse set of people, which leads to richer results. 


### Make compromises, if needed

Especially if you are short on money and/or time, you may need to compromise and do research with participants that do not match your intended users exactly. However, if their motivations, activities and problems are similar, you are still likely to learn from these participants. But if they are similar only in demographics or profession rather than in their activities, your cannot expect meaningful results. 

If you design an app for people to create bibliographies and you can only get some bachelor’s and master’s students, but no professors, your results will still reveal a lot about the processes of creating bibliographies. The student’s motivation is probably writing final term papers and the professors would like to write journal papers. This is a possible difference — as long as you aware of it, you are probably fine. But if you want to design a skateboard and the only participants you can get are elderly people who enjoy hiking, you are in trouble (if you find elderly people who enjoy skating, go for it).

### A small number of participants is fine

There are no clear-cut rules of how many participants are enough. However, most of my projects have between 3 and 8 participants. If I really need to be sure I would do research with 10, but that is about the limit I can manage on my own.

You may think that conducting user research with more participants is generally better; you just could shorten each session, ask fewer questions and skip observing the participants. But you need time with each participant if you want to find out about the “how” and “why” of the participants’ work. Several sessions in hurry will lead to less useful results than research with one participant done right.

Nevertheless, only doing research on very few users will restrict the variance of data — like noticing that there may be several ways to do something. As well, you might not see which patterns are consistent among several people and which vary—which would certainly be impossible if you only had one or two participants. However, despite the constraints of such small samples they can still lead the helpful insights.

When estimating how many participants you need, consider how much time or money you can spend on doing the research. Each additional participant gives you additional data and a broader view on your possible users. However, each research session needs time do and adds to the amount of data to be analyzed.

An efficient way of involving the “right” number of participants is doing your research iteratively: start with two or three participants and analyze the data (how this is done is described in the section on [Analyzing Data](#Analysis))

Take a look at the (preliminary) findings: If the results seem clear and consistent, you may do research with few additional participants to refine and check and to explore details — or, if time is up, leave it the way it is.

If preliminary findings are unclear or contradictory, you may need to involve more participants.

Reasons for the such unsatisfactory results could be:

* Your research encompasses different groups of people with different needs — For example, the groups “students” and “professors” share some traits, but many characteristics will vary.
* The topic of your research is too broad — for example, “How do people do design” is very broad, “How do interface designers involve system specifications of engineers in their designs” is more specific.
* Even if your research is focused and there is only one group of people involved, the actual patterns just vary.

In all these cases you can involve more participants — but before you do, try to check if you…

* …need to clarify your research topic (to focus your efforts)
* …need to specify the involved groups (to recruit the right participants)


If you come from research based on measurements and statistics, it can be unusual to have few participants and to refine your research iteratively. In user need research we focus on collecting rich data and making sense of it by asking new questions and refining interpretations. To be able to do this we spend our resources on working with data from a few participants in depth.

## Prepare the research session

The “Research session” is your time with the participant in which you listen to them and observe their activities. If you are prepared, it helps you to focus on the tasks at hand.

### Think of possible topics and questions for your research

Before the research session, I try to get an overview of what I want to explore. I usually structure this along three topics: The **Motivations**, **Activities** and **Problems** of the participants.

These topics are relevant for design, and they can be easily remembered even in the midst of research: Three points are few and you can use the mnemonic M-A-P: Motivations, Activities, Problems.

**Motivations** — what does the participant want to achieve? What is important for them? Motivations can give you context to what the participant’s do. 

* *“Can you describe the worst experience in your day so far?”*
* *“Which tasks in your job do you like the most?”*
* *“Can you show me a piece of work you are proud of?”*

<!-- *Questions about Motivations are usually about emotions and goals. Since people act in ways to achieve their motivations, they often their relation to activities as well. You can explore these relations further in follow-up questions—*“You said you hate talking with this client. What in particular makes it a bad experience for you?”*.-->

**Activities** — what does the participant do? How do they do it? What are solutions, processes, “hacks” do they use? Activities are the core part of research: This is what can be observed and where things happen. 

* *“Can you describe the task you are currently working on?”*
* *“Can you show me how you use the application?”*

<!-- When asking about activities you can often use follow up questions to find out why and how users do what they do: *“You said, you apply paragraph styles. What do they do?”* or *“You just used that ›align‹ function—before, you placed objects manually. What is the difference between those activities?.”* -->

**Problems** — what is in the way of the participant getting to their goals? Problems can make you and the participant aware of motivations and activities that are so familiar, that you don't think of them—until something gets in the way. 

* *“When do you feel hindered or slowed down?”*
* *“Can you show me how you circumvent this from happening?”*
* *“What will happen if you can’t solve this problem?”*

List the topics you want to explore and structure them in a way that is meaningful to you. This list of topics can then be used to create a cheat sheet for the research session.


### Write a cheat sheet to use in the research session

A cheat sheet is a little memory aid that you can take with you when you collect data.

What goes into such a sheet? The biggest part will be topics you want to explore and the **questions** that you want to ask for this.

<!-- TODO: Check if this works -->
> 
> User Code:_______ , Date: ________
> 
>  *  Tell the reason for research: Improving communication with clients for freelancing designers. 
>  *  Tell how the research session will be (asking, listening, observing; 30-60min) 
>  *  Ask to read consent form and sign if OK 
> 
> Intro: 
>  
> * Is there a current project or task?
> * [explore task]
>
> Initial task/handover:
> 
> * How do they get in contact with a client
> * How is information being exchanged?
> * Getting to know each other? Trust?
> 
> * Process diagram: Getting a project started
> …



When you write the questions on the cheat sheet,
start with the general topics and progress towards more specific ones.
This is the order that makes sense in the course of a research session.
Nevertheless, that order is only a helpful guess. You will usually deviate a bit (or a lot) from your cheat
sheet.

Often, I include some kind of **checklist** on the top, especially if
there are legal matters involved, such as signing a consent form. Thus, I
can tick off what we already dealt with and immediately see if I forgot something.

You may wonder about the “User Code” in the example above. When I do research, every participant gets an identification code that can be used instead of their name (like “User2”). Latest when you publish the research, you do want to retract all names and other identifying information. Using such code, you can identify participants without their names. This is useful to keep the participant’s privacy, particularly if you share or discuss preliminary results. If you need to retain the names you can keep a _separate_ list, so you can convert the codes back. An alternative to codes is to ask participants how they want to appear in the (published) research, so they can choose if they want their legal name, another name or a code be used to represent them. 


The cheat sheet is a tool to support you during the interview and help you along when your
mind goes blank for a moment. It is not for ensuring that you ask all questions in the same
way and in the same order. Instead of controlling the situation, user need research emphasizes
the exploring the situation. If the participant does or tells something which is new to you, use it to learn and feel free to come up with new questions which are not on the cheat sheet.

### Take along tools that help you to record data easily

With a participant talks about new and interesting things you want to
be able to remember what was said. Thus, we record the interview — and we
will need some equipment for doing that:

![Equipment for user research: paper, pen, audio recorder.](images/interviewEquipment.svg)

- For note-taking and sketching
	- Paper, lined or blank (15 or more sheets, just to be safe)
	- Pencil or Pen (Don't forget to bring backups!)
	- Something to write on. A clipboard is great
-  Audio Recording (recommended)
	- Audio recorder or smartphone <!-- TODO link to record audio -->
-  Photos and video (recommended)
	- A digital camera or smartphone <!-- link to record photos -->
- For drawing diagrams with the participant
	-   Templates <!-- : link to diagrams -->
	-   Pencils and/or pens in different colors

You should get to know your equipment before you start the actual data collection. So be sure to know how make a photo and start and stop the audio-recording. Check the audio quality by putting the phone/recorder roughly a meter away from you and saying some sentences in your normal voice. Listen to the recording to test if you can understand what you said. 

When your equipment is ready and checked, you can start to collect your data.
