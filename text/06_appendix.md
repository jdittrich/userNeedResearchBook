### Books

#### Design focused
 
These books are written for designers and user researchers. The methods and examples are immediately useful for design work. 

*  **Observing the User Experience : A Practitioner's Guide to User Research** by Goodman, Elizabeth; Kuniavsky, Mike; Moed, Andrea. 2nd Edition. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2012. ISBN 978-0-123-84870-3 <br /> *Covers multiple user research methods as well as research planning, recruiting and communicating results. Particularly interesting are the chapters on recruiting and analysis of qualitative data.*
* **Interviewing Users : How to Uncover Compelling Insights** by Portigal, Steve. 1. Edition. New York: Rosenfeld Media, LLC, 2013. ISBN 978-1-9-33-82-0 <br /> *As the title suggests, it’s focused on asking questions and listening to answers, but it covers additional methods as well. Includes lots of useful tips.*
* **Rapid Contextual Design : A How-to Guide to Key Techniques for User-centered Design** by Holtzblatt, Karen; Wendell, Jessamyn Burns; Wood, Shelley. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2005. ISBN 978-0-123-54051-5 <br /> *Describes a collection of methods for user research. It is aimed at bigger teams (with time and money, I assume). However, its mentioned here since the idea of grouping data as core activity of data analysis is from it.*
* **Mental Models: Aligning Design Strategy with Human Behavior** by  Indi Young. Rosenfeld Media. ISBN-13:  978-1-933-82006-4 <br /> *Describes a research process with lots of useful methods and structures going from participant group selection up to sharing research based product feature opportunities. A particular focus is on user activities and recruiting based on them.* 

#### Academic focus

These are books written for academic researchers. Why should you bother with academic books if there are some specifically for designers? Books aimed for an academic audience also cover topics that are easily brushed over. This might be ethics, data analysis and different paradigms for it and the question if there are a “true findings". All this can be very useful if you find yourself researching sensitive topics, need to come up with custom methods or if you need to explain and defend a particular approach.

* **Shane, the Lone Ethnographer: A Beginner's Guide to Ethnography** by Galman, Sally Campbell. Lanham: Rowman Altamira. ISBN 978-0-759-10344-3 <br /> *Lots of the methods I described originated in ethnography. This book gives an hands-on and thoughtful introduction to ethnography. Comes as a comic and is fun to read. Minor flaw: The lettering is a bit obscure*
* **The Good, the Bad, and the Data** by Galman, Sally Campbell.  Walnut Creek, California: Routledge, 2017. ISBN 978-1598746327 <br /> *Shane is back and now she focuses on data analysis. Great overview of established paradigms. Like the “Lone Ethnographer” it is a comic and easy to understand. I think the lettering’s readability was improved a bit.*
* **Successful Qualitative Research : A Practical Guide for Beginners** by Clarke, Victoria; Braun, Virginia. London: SAGE, 2013. ISBN 978-1-847-87581-5 <br /> *This book is aimed at  aspiring academic researchers. Hands-on, but covers the underlying (social science) theory as well. It inspired much of the analysis section in this book. Interesting for those who want to know more about doing thorough analysis of data (using the method of “Thematic Analysis”)*
* **The Ethnographic Interview** by  James P. Spradley. Waveland Press. ISBN-13: 978-1478632078 <br /> *Focuses on understanding the participants’ language and jargon and consequently less on participants’ activities. Nevertheless a great intro, particularly the annotated examples.* <!-- thanks to Jonathan Morgan, Wikimedia, for suggesting this book -->
