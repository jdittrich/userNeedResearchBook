# Learning from research participants {#dataGathering}

_This chapter covers:_

* _Preparing your research sessions_
* _Observing, listening and co-documenting with research participants_
* _Collecting data for later analysis_

You have prepared your research, arranged a meeting with a participant, and informed them of what to expect. Now you are ready to learn first-hand about the participant’s motivations, activities, and problems by meeting them, listening to their stories, and observing their work.

This chapter gives you guidance of how to learn best from your participant. A large part is about asking questions and guiding conversations. You are also interested in what people _do_. To learn about activities, your conversation is mixed with participants demonstrating their work. You take notes and pictures to aid your memory. Participants can take an active role and document their work: You can involve them in drawing diagrams of processes or social relations, to document their work together. At the end of the research session, you will summarize what you learned and give the participant an opportunity to ask questions. After the session ends, you will complement and organize your data. Only then is the research session over.

<!-- TODO: compare to asking open questions again↓ -->

It is a common misconception about user research that it is asking what people want or how much they like a feature. But your research won't delve into future ideas and designs—you are not going to ask “do you think that [a gadget] would help you?”

It is hard to guess if an imaginary thing would be great to have in the future. Instead of working with product ideas, you will learn the how and why of your participants’ activities. This allows you to evaluate your ideas (“Are my ideas consistent with what participants consider essential?”) and get inspiration for new ideas (“how can I support this activity?”).

See your participants as competent in what they do: they are experts in their daily work. This goes against the notion that people “don't get it” and need help from designers and programmers. Assume participants have a reason for doing their work the way they do it. If you're wondering about the actions of the participants, find out why they act the way they do.

Before you learn from the participant, let's go over what you need to prepare.

## Set up the research session

Preparing the research session prevents later problems. Send a reminder to participants and have your recording equipment ready.

### Remind participants

It can be helpful for you and your participants to send a short reminder mail to participants the day before you meet them. (If you recruit via an agency, they might do it.) Here is an example:


> Hello Sarah,
>
> I look forward to meeting you tomorrow at Small Avenue 123 at 12:00pm. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach contact me.
>
> Jan


If you are coming with a research partner, let the participant know, so they are not surprised if a second person comes. Also tell the participant know your research partner’s name and pronouns, so the participant can address them properly.



### Prepare your note-taking and recording equipment

To collect data, you should have your recording equipment ready. This is what I usually bring along for in-person meetings:

* *Printed Cheat sheet* (I described [how to write a cheat sheet](#cheatsheet) in a previous section)
* *Paper on clipboard*: You might need to write on your lap or while standing.
* *Pens or pencils*: Whatever you like to use. If you plan to sketch or co-document with the participants, take some felt pens in black, red, and green along.
* *Audio recorder*: A simple device for about 50€ is sufficient. It should connect to your computer via USB or take micro SD cards, so you can transfer the files on your computer easily. More expensive models, like a _Zoom H2_, have better microphones and more settings. You can also record with your phone if the quality is fine for you. Test it beforehand in an environment similar to where you will hold the research session.

When you meet online, the tools are different. In this situation, you should have the following prepared:

* *Video-conferencing app*: There are many of them. Which one you choose depends on your organization, potential legal restrictions (like [GDPR](#protectionIdentity)) and participant preferences.
* *Headset*: Often has better sound quality than the built-in microphone. If you want or need to use your built-in microphone, check how audible keystrokes and mouse clicks are—on some devices they drown out any other sounds!
* *Printed cheat-sheet*: Opening it on your computer would take up screen space that you might want to use for the video chat and notetaking.
* *Writing on paper or computer*: Both writing in a text file or writing on paper is fine. If you can touch-type, you can write notes and look at the camera.
* *Whiteboarding-app*: Whiteboarding apps like miro, mural, or tldraw are a remote equivalent to pens and sheets for collaborative activities. They've improved a lot in recent years, but ease of using pen and paper is still unmatched—your mileage may vary, especially for people who are not familiar with such tools. 

### Brief your research partner

If you are conducting research with a research partner, you should have a conversation about what you are going to do in the research session, how you want to divide tasks, and what you both should be aware of. Your research partner should also know when and where you are going to meet for the research session itself and if they should bring equipment.

It is common for research partners to be new to user research but curious about it. If your research partner does not have experience with user research, it is best if they start with supporting tasks like taking notes. In a [later section](#captureData) I explain how to take notes, sketch, and make photos and audio recordings. It's also good to show your research partner an example of notes from previous research. It may be unusual for them to make detailed notes instead of summarizing strongly. For example, they may only write “Likes the software” when the participant talks for a couple of minutes how they like to use a product. An example easily shows what you think the notes should look like.

As your research partner gains experience, they may take a more active role from time to time. If you think that your research partner can and should ask the participant questions, tell your research partner—otherwise they may not. Remember that, if the research partner takes an active role, you need to take the notes.

## How to start the research session

When you arrive at the location you do the research at, greet the participant and take care the both you and your co-researcher (if present) are introduced to the participant. Usually, a short bit of small talk will follow. This is pretty normal and it happens intuitively. It helps to build trust and to get used to the research situation. But after a brief time both you and your participant will want to get started with your research session proper. You can initiate this by saying something like: \
_“So… I’m happy that we can do this and that you could free some time for showing and telling me about your experiences with cooking with online recipes.”_

Give some context of why that is interesting to you:\
_“We are thinking about improving the usefulness of the recipes that we present to people. We have some enthusiasts in our community, but also a lot of people who do not consider themselves particularly good at cooking and we are wondering what we could do for them.”_

Explain that you are here to learn—and not to judge the quality of the participant’s work:\
_“…that's why we would like to know more about how you cook and how you use recipes or videos for it. This is not a test. No matter if you cook elaborate meals or not: You are an expert in your kitchen, you know best what you need, and we like to learn more.”_

Although you may have already described the time frame and the research method when recruiting the participant, tell them again what you will do:\
_“We will talk about your work and will ask some questions. In addition, I’m interested in watching you cook. This is, as we talked when we had contact via mail, why we came slightly ahead of the usual time you prepare your meal. The whole process takes about an hour.”_

In case they did not already agree to the consent form via email, you can use a written consent form and explain its purpose and content.

The participant must know how you record data and who will access it, even if they already agreed to recording before via mail. So, tell the participant:\
_“I'd like to take notes, and, in addition, record audio—if you're okay with that. The recording helps me to focus on your work, because then I don't have to concentrate on writing everything down. A colleague and I will listen to the audio for transcription; We will anonymize the transcribed data before we share it with the product design team. If you feel uncomfortable with being recorded at any time, we can pause or stop the recording.”_

In my experience, it is rare that someone does not agree to being recorded. If that happens, you can ask politely if they have any specific worries—they might agree when they have additional information about how the data is used and handled. 

> This is an example form an in-house research project, where I visited a programmer from another department in a larger company. After explaining the process, the participant said this:
>
> _Participant_: “Audio recording… I’m not sure…”
>
> _Researcher_: “That’s fine with me. May I ask what worries are?”
>
> _Participant_: “Hmm… yeah, aren't you from HR?”
>
> _Researcher_: “I understand your concern. It is fine if you don’t agree to the audio recording. I can assure you that HR is a separate department. We work in the product department on internal tool, that is, we help to improve the applications you use to do your work.
>
> We do not share personal data and what we record today is not accessible to them. Also, any data that leaves my computer or the one of my colleague is anonymized, and we remove any data that points to you as person, including the names and so on.”
>
> _Participant_: “Oh, sure, them… I just assumed you were from HR and wouldn't have liked the recording thing, you know.”
>
> It could have happened that the concerns of the participant were not resolved by me clarifying that I am not from Human Resources. If they were still fine with the research, but not with the recording—so be it. We would have taken notes instead: It’s their choice.

It goes without saying that it is important that you accommodate the participant’s wishes and respect their agency. There may be situations where the participant, for example, hesitates to respond or seems uneasy, possibly because of a question or a request of yours. Do not push them if they seem uncomfortable, even if you want to hear their answer. Offer them a way out of such situations if you unintentionally caused one. You can, for example suggest an alternative task or say that it is fine not to answer and go to the next question. The well-being of the participant is your primary concern.

Now you and the participant are ready to move into the conversation about the topics you want to learn about. To do this it’s helpful to consider how you can learn from the participant.

## Methods to learn from participants

You can engage with participants in several ways: listening, observing, and co-documenting their activities. Each method has its own strengths, and provides insight into different aspects, so it's common to combine different approaches.

### Listening and asking questions

A common way of learning from a participant is by asking questions and listening to the participant’s answers. Aim for rich, story-like descriptions that about the user’s motivations, activities, and their context. To encourage the participant to provide such story-like answers, you often need to ask for descriptions of an activity and the reasons for doing it. So, your questions may be something like this: “Can you tell me why you chose this recipe?” or “You said you will brown the onions—how do you do that?”

Asking questions and getting answers from a participant is a very versatile tool. It can be done without many resources. In addition, you are not tied to a specific place, and you can talk about both past events and future plans.

However, it can happen that you hardly focus on actual experiences and instead talk about events in the abstract. Observations are therefore a good complement to asking questions and listening.

### Observing

<!-- this section is fairly long and should probably be broken up into several parts -->

Only listening to people might not be the best way to understand what they are doing. Just like a picture is worth a thousand words, it is often helpful to ask participants to show what they talk about and to demonstrate how they work. Frequently, it is also easier for participant and researcher alike. 

As you observe, you can notice things your participants would never consider to mentioning, because they're second nature to them: The tools they use,  how they apply these tools, and which problems they meet. But you can observe it. You also can learn about the context of their work, like means of communicating with colleagues or cues in the environment that point out problems—for example quick fixes on devices using tape and cardboard, or added instructions on machines.

![A coffee machine with added instructions on an orange note, telling that the buttons are for “Full Cup”, “Half Cup”, “Espresso”.](images/03_dataGathering_coffeeMachineUserChanges.jpg){#coffeeMachineUserChanges alt="Button panel of an automatic coffee machine which is labeled with icons; above the buttons is an orange note, telling that the buttons are for “Full Cup”, “Half Cup”, “Espresso”"}

It is not necessary to have observation as a separate step in the research process. It is best to interweave observation with asking questions and listening. For example, you can ask for a demonstration instead of a description. 

> If the participant tells you:\
> “So, as I have the recipe opened here, and read through the list of things I need, I would now start getting out the ingredients”\
> you could suggest: “Great—if it’s fine with you, let’s actually do that!”

Think of yourself as the participant's apprentice. The participant is the expert who can teach you some of their skills. This means that understanding the participant by observing is not a passive process. Like an apprentice, you can and should ask questions. 

> You can _ask about reasons_, for example\
> “You did measure the weight of the flour on the scale, but the for the water you just used a cup. Why?”\
> Or  _ask about things you notice in the environment_, for example:\
> “Are there certain things you do at specific places?”

Teaching an apprentice is not a theoretical or artificially set-up process: The tasks you observe should be tasks that the participant is actually doing (and not something set up for you). 

> If the participant asks you “What should I do now?”, 
> you can reply with “What would you do if I would not be here?”

Of course, what you observe should also be relevant to _your_ interests. The conversation could continue in this way:

> _Participant_: “I would either start to make this stir-fry vegetables, or actually, only heat something up for lunch and rather make some apple crumble for dessert”\
> _Researcher_: “If you don’t have a preference, I would be curious to see how you make the apple crumble—I have not seen how people make dessert in our research, yet!”

From time to time, you might observe actions that seem wrong or at least not optimal: People might seem to ignore a feature that could make their work much more efficient, or they just never use a product that you focus your research interests on. Remain curious and don’t be judgmental. If you start judging and even possibly “correcting” their practices, you close yourself off to the reasons for the participant's actions. Also, your participant would stop being open about showing you how they work. 

Participants are experts in their work and have a reason for what they do. Maybe they do not want to be more effective because it would mean that their superiors would increase expectations, leaving no wiggle room for everyday contingencies. Maybe they routinely prevent situations from happening where they would need a certain technological solution and thus have no need for it.

### Co-documenting {#coDocumenting}

You can also document the work with the participant directly. I call this _co-documenting_ because both you and the participant document some aspect of the participant’s life directly through drawing and writing. This can be as simple as asking the participant: _“Draw a floor plan of your kitchen. Please highlight what is important for your work and write why!”_

Here are examples of co-documenting results. Most of them are based on a template that guides the participant.
To document the context of the participant, you can use a _social space map_ as shown in the [following figure](#socialNetworkDiagramExample). The participant is in the center, and they add who is relevant for them. Many participants do not limit themselves to people and might add institutions, roles, or technologies that are also important to them.


![The participant is in the center. They draw people (or whatever else they think matters) around them and write the nature of the connection on the arrows.](images/03_dataGathering_socialNetworkDiagramExample.png){#socialNetworkDiagramExample alt="A diagram where a research participant drew connections relevant for their cooking: Utensils, YouTube, flatmates"}


The timeline-diagram in the next figure is great for getting an overview of which parts of a longer process participants like and dislike.

![If the graph goes up, the mood gets better, if it goes down, the participant feels bad, bored, or annoyed.](images/03_dataGathering_timelineDiagramExample.png){#timelineDiagramExample alt="A diagram where a research participant indicated their mood during recipe selection and cooking"}

The timeline-diagram usually covers a longer period of time from a bird's eye view. Often, you also want to know details about a process. To do this, you can use a recipe-like list of steps, as shown in the next figure:

![A recipe-like overview with sketches to show how to make coffee.](images/03_dataGathering_stepDiagramExample.png){#stepDiagramExample alt="A recipe-like overview with sketches to show how to make coffee"}

If you have the documentation in front of you and the participant, you can easily improve as you create it. You as a researcher, can refer to the documentation and ask for elaboration (“Is this the cupboard where you keep the ingredients?”).

The fact that researcher and participant both need to understand the documentation is a check against unclear terms, vague references, and sloppy handwriting. This makes the results accessible and useful.

A situation in which this is relevant could happen like this:

> _Researcher_: “The line here seems to indicate that you were very happy at the beginning…”\
> _Participant_: “Yes, the recipe just looked awesome, I really wanted to try it”\
> _Researcher_: “Can you write this in the diagram, so I can understand it later?” \
> _Participant_: [Writes as comment in the diagram] “Recipe looks awesome!” \

Who does the drawing and writing depends on what is more convenient and provides more interesting data. When researching workflows, _I_ write the documentation as a researcher, because the participant should be able to demonstrate their tasks directly, which is difficult when you have to constantly switch between demonstrating and writing. When the participants document a project on a timeline, _they_ draw it directly, and I only ask questions.

For some participants, documenting their work by drawing and writing can be a bit unusual. It can be helpful to show a simple example of what the result of a co-documentation. The example can also reduce anxiety in drawing related tasks—some people assume they need to produce a work of art. Showing that a rough sketch is okay will help them to get started.

> _Tip:_ Try  creating some diagrams about _your_ work to get a feel for it. Select an activity and choose a diagram to document that activity. Review the result: what could it tell another person about that activity? What does it not tell? Try another diagram type for the same activity: where do both diagrams convey the same information? Where do they differ?

It can be easier for the participant if you provide a template instead of a blank page: It provides a basic structure. The template should have fields for name, date, title, and space for the participant’s diagram. Sometimes, I also print a small example in a corner of the template. The following figure is an example for a template that I use for timeline diagrams. 

![Example template for mood-timeline-diagrams.](images/03_dataGathering_templateGoodBadTime.png){#templateGoodBadTime alt="A template for a mood-timeline diagram: A horizontal time arrow, and a vertical axis with a smiley (top/up) and a frowning face (bottom/down)"}

Co-documentation works well in combination with interviewing and observation: You can co-document workflows in combination with observing the workflows, or you can transition from interviewing to co-documenting a specific aspect (“That is interesting! I would like to remember it clearly later on, so I would like to write the steps down with you”) later, you can use the documentation to refer back to it (“You wrote… How does relate to…”) and add further details.

Co-documenting via lists, diagrams, and drawings may seem unusual at first. But they produce very useful and easy-to-interpret data by having the researcher and the participant work together. It can empower the participants that they do not only actively show and tell but also take part in recording.


## Ways to capture data {#captureData}

Without recording data, you need to rely on memorizing what you saw and heard. As there is a lot to learn from participants, it makes sense to support your memory by capturing data in writing, photography and audio recordings. What you record is strongly connected to how you engage with the participant: A conversation lends itself to notes and audio recording, the work process to sketches, diagrams and maybe even short film clips. However, there is not a 1:1 match of a way to learn from participants and ways to record data: Sometimes a verbal description is helpful for an action focused activity, some people might record a conversation in a more diagram-like form to see central objects and conflicts.

If you have a research partner with you, it is a common division of labor that the research partner focuses on the recording. However, if needed, they can ask for clarifications as they may notice gaps in the data they record.

Even if you have a research partner taking care of the recording, you should be familiar with the equipment. It may happen that they are late or get sick, so you need to record the data yourself. If you have the opportunity to work with an experienced researcher, you could also take on the role of research partner and focus on recording.

Before you take photos or make an audio recording, ask the participant if they are okay with this. 

### Notes and sketches

While you observe or listen to the participant, you should take brief notes. It's a bit like taking notes at school or university: you go into the gist of what's being said in as much detail as possible, but you don't write down the exact words (unless you personally find a particular phrase important).  One utterance or observation concerning one topic goes in one line, bullet-point style.

When you're looking down at your notes and are thinking about what to write, listening and observing don’t work well. Try to keep it as unobtrusive as possible. If you don’t care too much about your handwriting, you can write notes without much looking at the paper except for some occasional glances. When you do the meeting remotely you can do notes by handwriting, too, or use your computer. Just check for keyboard noises—they can be annoying, even if you use a microphone. 

Taking notes alongside other activities can be challenging. That's why it's good if you have a co-researcher who can help you: One person can ask questions and guide through the research, the other person takes notes. Both observe and listen.

![Notes from a research session](images/03_dataGathering_notesExample1.png){#notesExample1 alt="Interview and Observation notes. They are not very tidy; they are combined with little sketches"}

If you record audio in parallel, you can be more relaxed when writing what was said. However, you still need to take notes to record what you observed. Participants will also point to things and refer to them as “it” and “that”; without notes it can be difficult to reconstruct what the participant was talking about. In the [previous example notes](#notesExample1), I used little sketches to record what the participant was doing.

When taking notes in research, I often write about 1 page every 15 minutes. That’s why notes of a typical session won’t fit a single page or on the margins of your cheat sheet.

After data collection, you complete, transcribe, and analyze your notes. Between gathering the data and reviewing your notes, it is easy to forget the context. 

For example, if you observe that someone tastes a bit of their dish and then adds a small amount of sugar, you might just write “sugar”. It could make perfect sense at the moment you write it, since you are watching what is going on, and you know what happened before and after. But without this implicit knowledge of the situation, the line “sugar” does make little sense. Instead, write something like “Tastes → Adds a bit of sugar”. It will help you a lot later when you read your notes. 

Your observations will be visual and related to  processes. A good way to support your memory of observations is to create sketches or small process diagrams.

![A small sketch from my notes, showing where a participant did different activities](images/03_dataGathering_sketchExample1.png){#sketchExample1 alt="Sketch of washing, chopping, cooking at their respective places"}

It is not important that your sketches look realistic. Realism is better achieved by cameras. Take advantage of the fact that sketches are different from photos: Enlarge what is relevant, leave out what is irrelevant and make annotations with arrows and notes on what was happening.


### Taking photos

Taking photos is easy and can capture a lot of information.  For example, you can photograph the participant’s kitchen to aid your memory. Later, you can go back to the photo when you read your notes. Where was their fridge, where was the stove? Where did they put used utensils and cutting boards? 

You can also photograph screens of computers and gadgets if you have the participant’s consent to do this. A software-based screenshot might, in theory, be superior—but if the user does not know how to take a screenshot, a camera is a handy way to capture the screen.

You should be able to take photos with your camera or phone quickly and reliably. Use a device you know. The only setting that I use is the exposure compensation. This function is useful when the automatic setting for exposure fails you and an important part of the image is totally dark or disappears in light. Exposure compensation allows adjusting for that.

### Recording audio

I recommend using audio recordings—it is a useful complement to your notes. Audio recording allows you to listen to what was said in the research session.

Audio recordings are not a perfect capture of everything  that happened: If the participant points to an ingredient or utensil and refers to “this”, the recording is not much of help. People use such expressions a lot when they talk about activities, so you need your notes to complement the audio.

Photos and audio records complement notes and sketches well. They are, however, not superior to manual recordings: They are different, and you can use that difference to combine their strengths.

## Assure and encourage the participant

At the beginning of the research session, the participant may feel insecure. Most people do not have experience as research participants, so they might be concerned about doing something wrong or unhelpful. To make the participant feel comfortable, it is important to support the participant and show them that you are interested in their work and explanations.

### Affirm that you listen

You ask questions that aim for descriptions and longer answers. This means, you _listen_ to the participant most of the time. You probably have some intuitive reactions that  signal that you are listening—like nodding or saying “yes” or “mm-mhh”. These are ways to ensure the participant that you are listening to what they are saying.

Asking follow-up questions also shows that you care about in what participants say and do. Follow-up questions can be about topics the participant mentioned or workflows that they demonstrated. You can also summarize what you heard and saw: “So, you said that…”. This allows you to check your understanding and show that you listened keenly—without judging what is being said.

Some participants may  assume that you can not learn anything from them assuming you already know about their work. For example, if you are from the company that developed a product they use, they might assume that you know about everything they possibly could do with it. Even if you know the product well, you probably do not know how people use it in practice and what its limitations are in such situations. You can tell them: “Thanks, it can seem this way, but I only create a small part of (Product) development and I am not an expert on (whatever the product is used for). I think I can learn a lot about how (product) is actually used in the real world!”

### Make a friendly impression through  body language.

Probably, you would not make a bad impression anyway, but let’s go through it nevertheless: Don’t appear angry or stern by frowning and crossing arms and legs. Don’t look careless by leaning back and looking to the ceiling. During the interview, show reactions to what the participant says or does. If you take notes, looking at the participant is not possible all the time—but try to show that you are attentive when you can. 

## Be open to how the participant works and thinks

In user need research, you want to learn from participants. This is exciting as you have no way of knowing what you will learn. What you learn unexpectedly is often critical to developing your understanding of the participants and to recognizing potential risks and opportunities. However, it is not easy to be open to these experiences.  Not knowing what you learn is unsettling. In our everyday lives, we often trade the openness for efficiency and predictable outcomes. To stay open to how the participant works and thinks is a skill that must be learned—but there are some basic principles that can be of great help: Asking open questions, not suggesting answers, and embracing the value of silence.

### Ask open questions

Open questions are questions that do prompt longer, descriptive answers. You already read about open questions in the [section on writing your research session questions](#prepareResearch). Open questions can be contrasted with closed questions, which have only a closed range of meaningful answers. Asking participants open questions will lead to concrete and descriptive answers and potentially lead to insights that you did not expect.

I'll revisit the subject here because only a part of the questions you ask will be questions you wrote down previously. You will also come up with questions that are responding to what you hear or see when being with the participant. It often makes sense to ask these questions as open questions, too.

In order to be able to come up with open questions during the conversation, it can be helpful to have some easy-to-remember phrases that help to ask open questions:

* Starting your questions with “Can you tell me more about…” invites descriptive, longer answers: “Can you tell me more how cooking for a large family is like?”
* Asking “How”-Questions invites description or demonstration of activities: “How do you go about choosing recipes” or “How did you learn what ‘sautéing’ meant?”

These phrases are useful for asking open questions. There are also phrases you might want to avoid as they usually start closed questions.

When it comes to product development, it's quite tempting to ask “would you…” questions, like “Would you like to bookmark recipes?” Such questions are problematic for two reasons:

* They ask the participant to make assumptions about their future, which is not very reliable.
* They often invite short answers like “yes” or “No”, like “Yes, bookmarks sound good.”

“Is” is another word that often leads to closed questions that are answered with “yes” or “no”: “Is it difficult to cook a risotto?”—“No, not really.”

> _Tip:_ Sometimes closed questions can be a stepping stone to asking open questions. “Would you like to bookmark recipes?” points to a relevant activity: About re-finding and organizing recipes. An open question based on this could be “How do you look up recipes again which you liked in the past?”

By using phrases like “Can you tell me more” or “How do you…” you can ask open questions in response to what participant says or does. While closed-ended questions are sometimes helpful, more often they are not. Rephrasing closed “Would you” and “Is…” questions can help you to get more interesting answers.


### Do not suggest “right” or “wrong” answers or processes {#rightAnswers}

A common concern of researchers is influencing the participants. One way to deal with this concern is to define how questions should be asked by giving a strict script.

But creating artificially constant conditions would cause you to lose the strengths of the methods described here: Being able to find out about new and unexpected things and gaining understanding of the how-and-why by reacting on the situation. Each participant and their context are different. You can accommodate this by adjusting the research to the context. This would not be possible if you would ask the same questions every time. Being able to react to situations is essential and a strength of the research method.

However, what I think is relevant, is to consider how your own assumptions and wishes can lead to suggesting favorable answers. Such influence in research takes different forms: “This is good, isn’t it?!” Is a very obvious influence, since it as it bluntly expresses what you think the answer should be: a “yes.”

There are also less obvious influences, for example by asking “Would you like a better version of this?”—who doesn't want something better?! Again, the answer the participant is going to give is “yes”.

In addition to your questions, you could also suggest “right” ways of doing something with direct reactions. For example, if a participant says “I can’t read the recipes on the website, and there is no mobile view to make them readable”, it may be tempting to say: “No, there is!” if the participant did not notice the feature.

Remember, you want to find out what your participant is doing and why. Correcting the participant immediately rarely leads to new insights. Instead, you can simply ask “what do you do then?”, or, if talking about the function itself is important to you, you can ask “What is an example for a website that does it better?”

That being said, if you can clearly help the participant with a simple bit of information, explore the topic and share your knowledge immediately afterward —while not “correcting” the participant: “That was very helpful for me to learn! The team building the website will appreciate learning about such problems. What they assumed is that people trigger mobile view by…”

You may also be surprised or even annoyed by steps or actions in a workflow of the user that seem outright superfluous.\
 _Participant_: “When I want to share a recipe, I take a photo of the screen like this… and then I can forward the image in a chat” \
You may think that this is pretty inefficient and be tempted to say “Why don’t you use the share-function or copy the web address?—that would be far more efficient!”

No one does inefficient actions because they are inefficient. Assume that the participant has a reason. Try to figure out what that reason might be.

Again, you could ask: “What’s the reason for you are doing it this way?”—and ask follow-up questions to further explore the issue. For example, they may prefer images because they show directly in chats and can easily be tapped to zoom in, whereas the original website would open in another app.

Don’t be afraid to react toward the participant and what they say or do. Adapting to the situation is essential in our research. But don’t judge the actions or answers of a participant. You are interested in the how and why of their work. When you judge what they are doing as right or wrong, questions that you could explore are cut off prematurely.

## Silence feels strange, but it’s okay

Sometimes, the participant takes time to think before answering. Intuitively you might want to fill the silence to help the participant.

> _Researcher_: “Can you tell me what happened after you put the pepper in the dish?”\
> (pause) “…was it okay?”
> 
> _Participant_: “Yeah, I think- ”

It is tempting to fill the silence with suggestions for the answer. But it can turn an open question (“can you describe…?”) into a closed question (“can you describe… was it…?”) or prevent the participant coming up with their answer on their own.

Try to tolerate the silence. Usually the participant answers within a few seconds. If you notice silence which you want to fill, count to three or five before probing further. Then, ask about the question rather than giving suggestions: “What makes the question hard to answer?” or “Can you tell me what you are thinking about?”

This way, you can help the participant to continue with elaborating on the question you are asking, even if it takes them some though to answer it.


## Take a closer look

Early in the research session, you only have some basic knowledge about what the participants do. You know some terms and what they describe. Later, you try to learn how it all connects, understand what the participant thinks is relevant and why, and see and experience easily glossed-over implicit knowledge about activities and skills. 

To learn more, you can probe with follow-up-questions, check your understanding, and ask for demonstrations.

### Probing

When I learn something new, I often have the feeling that this is just the beginning of a larger topic. In this case, I can “probe” for further information.

You already know one way to do this: silence. Just as you might intuitively want to fill the silence, the participant may just step in and fill the silence with further information.

> _Participant_: “Well, I found that recipe and I tried it once, but it was so-so”\
> (Short pause, researcher nods)
> 
> _Participant_: “I don’t know what the problem was, I guess something about the timing. Everything was just mushy”


Alternatively, you can also repeat the most recent statement or words the participant has said.

> _Participant_: “Well, I found that recipe and I tried it once, but it was so-so”
> 
> _Researcher_: “So-so?”
> 
> _Participant_:“I don’t know what the problem was, I guess something about the timing. Everything was just mushy.”

That way, you can help participants keep going without changing course by asking new questions.

If you want to know more about something specific, you can also ask directly: “Please tell me— What would you do if you had to wait?”

Asking directly can be useful if the participant has answered rather vaguely:

> _Participant_: “Well, I try to get some more information and try to find out where it got stuck”
> 
> _Researcher_: “Could you describe to me how you would do that?”


If you gather your data by observing or drawing diagrams with the participant, direct questions are very useful for exploring the work.

> _Researcher_: “You added pepper without first tasting or checking the recipe—how did you know it was needed?”
> 
> Or, when co-documenting with the participant in a diagram:
> 
> _Researcher_: “This graph seems to indicate that you were in a pretty good mood here. Could you explain a little bit why you seem less happy here [Points]?”

These methods allow you to gain additional information and show the participant that you are listening and observing carefully. Following up on observations and information is important for learning. However, sometimes you want to check your understanding. Even if everything makes sense to you, it is often good to check if your understanding makes sense to them.


### Check your understanding

To check my understanding, I often go back to what the participant talked about or showed me before. I tell them how I interpret a situation based on what I have learned from them and ask them if it makes sense to them. In this case, even closed (yes/no) questions are fine.

> _Researcher_: “You said it looks good, now. Did you think the pasta is ready now…?”
> 
> _Participant_: “No, I meant the sauce. It looks good, just like on the picture in the recipe.”

There are several benefits of checking your understanding:

* Avoid confusion and misinterpreted research due to misunderstandings.
* Show that you care about the participant’s expertise.
* Encourage participants to continue and tell you more.

For checking, you need to refer to something that you want to verify. You often need to describe it to the participant:

> _Researcher_: “So: If I wanted to cook something, would you first see what ingredients you have and then try to match a recipe?”
> 
> _Participant_: “Yes… I mean, somewhat. It matters. I don’t want things to go to waste.”


To refer to what you learned, use your notes as memory aid, and don’t be afraid to just point at things if you do not remember the correct term. The participant will tell you what the thing is called. For example, you could ask: “Can you tell me more about this does?” (points at a utensil)? Or when co-documenting: “Here (points to diagram) your motivation seemed to change quite quickly—can you tell me more about that?”

By checking your interpretations of the participant’s descriptions and activities, you can avoid misunderstandings and gain additional insights.

### Ask for examples

When participants mention an activity or tool they use, ask them if you could observe the activity or tool in action. Seeing an example avoids misunderstandings and offers rich opportunities for further insights:

> _Participant_: “…so I would just use the food processor for that.”
> 
> _Researcher_: “Can you show me how you do this?”


This avoids ambiguity as to what they meant by “use.” It is easiest for researcher and participant to look at it together.

You can also ask for examples to dig deeper into a topic. The participant may have mentioned a process before, and you can build upon this and ask to learn more about it:

> _Researcher_: “You said you would look on YouTube how to cut this. Can you show me how you do that?”
> 
> Or, without asking for a demonstration:\
> _Researcher_: “…what would you expect to find?”


Asking for examples provides a natural way to show your interest, expand on topics, and to move from a conversation to an observation. Switching methods and topics in your research is important to figuring out what is relevant to you, and that what I will cover in the next section.

> #### We have already built something, why not use it?!
> 
> When discussing [project types in the first chapter](#projectTypes), I wrote that user need research should be done early in projects. Often, however, people have already started designing something, such as a prototype or a concept document, and they will ask you if you can’t make this part of your research. You can, but some caveats apply.
> 
> When you bring up an idea or prototype, steer the conversation towards the effects on the participant’s work. Do not focus on whether they like it or whether they find it useful.
> 
> I introduce such ideas or prototypes by saying something like: “There are always a lot of ideas floating around. A colleague said they think about…” This reduces the risk of the participant assuming I am excited about the idea and wanting validation instead of learning from them.
> 
> Then, I show them the prototype or the idea. Sometimes it is working user interface, sometimes a competitor’s tool, sometimes just a few sketches or diagrams. But keep it simple—the gist of it should fit on one screen or printout, otherwise you will only create confusion.
> 
> After presenting the prototype or idea, focus your questions on how the participant expects it to affect their daily lives. You could ask: “How do you think would this fit into your work?” or “We do not know enough about your field of work, so we were wondering what the impact of such a product would be.” If the participant hesitates, it can be helpful to ask what _other people_ might think: “What would your [peers/team/family…] think about using this?” This is sometimes easier to answer and can yield insights into the participant’s social environment.
> 
> The participant’s response will help you to learn about their motivations, activities, and problems. For example, they might tell you: “Yeah, this idea keeps coming up. But it will not be used. Just doing it by browsing takes time, but it is fun. I do not want to make recipe selection more efficient!” or they tell you “I currently use Google Docs for this and only mention people there. But I’m having a hard time keeping track of all the feedback I got, and I sometimes wish it would be more orderly” You can then explore the topics deeper and ask: “Can you show me how your process works in Google Docs?”
> 
> I also had people who directly dismissed or were indifferent to what I was showing. They could easily tell why. This is actually great, as it avoids wasting more time and money on an idea.
> 
> If you use prototypes or ideas in your research, it should be clear to your colleagues that you do this to learn more about the _participant’s work_. When people ask you to “evaluate the concept” or “test the prototype” they want to learn about the _concept_ or _prototype_ and should do a usability test instead.
> 
> Introducing existing ideas and prototypes can help you learn more about the participant and the context they work in. The results can inform you next steps in working on the prototype or idea. This can only work successfully when you and your colleagues agree that the focus is on learning about the participant, not the idea or the prototype itself.

## Steer the course of research

A research session follows a structure: like in a film, you get to know the world and the protagonists before delving deeper into core issues. At the end you tie up loose ends and summarize what you learned. In order to navigate you and the participant smoothly from the beginning to the end of the research session, you need to provide guide topics and methods of the research session.

### Changing between topics

During the research session, you cover different topics. You can set some topics in advance because you think they are important. In order to use your time efficiently and to learn about the topics that are relevant to you, you sometimes have to nudge the participant in the direction that is interests you.

You may want to switch between topics if:

* There is probably nothing more to be found out.
* You have covered enough and need to move to another topic before time runs out (If this happens, plan in more time in the future)
* The participant is focusing on a topic that is not in the focus of your research.

To switch between topics, you can express your interest in the next topic: “Can you tell me more about recipes that you use frequently?”

Before moving to the next topic, you can end the section by restating what you learned previously: “Let me briefly summarize: […]. So, what would also be interesting for me: You said you have recipes that you go back to again and again—can you tell me about this?”

Switching topics can be particularly useful when a participant gets carried away with a topic that is not relevant for you.: “…there is another topic is important to me: You said you have recipes that you go back to again and again—can you tell me about this?”

To make the change of topics less abrupt, and to show that you have been listening carefully, you can refer to a topic that has been mentioned, but not yet explored: “When drawing the diagram, you mentioned that you would ask your mom about cooking—what is it you ask her?” or “You mentioned that you sometimes prefer printed recipes on paper. What is useful about them?”

By switching the topic, you can cover the topics you need to know about and get your research back on track. But sometimes you do not want to switch the topic, but change the way you approach the topic.

### Switch methods

Each method highlights different aspects of the participant’s motivations, activities, and problems. Therefore, it makes sense to transition between methods in your research. By using different methods on the same topic, you can gain new perspectives on it.


> (Here is a possible switch from interview to observation)\
> _Researcher_: “You told me your general process of cooking a meal. Do you think we could cook something now, so I get to see it in practice?”
> 
> In this case, you already have a description of the activity. By observing the process, you can gain a less abstract, more specific, and contextual look at it.

The methods you use on the same topic can be intertwined. For example, during the demonstration of the activity, the participant may add to their description: “[During cooking]I did not mention this before—I add some annotations to the recipes, in case I found some variant that I like or which is useful.”

Often, a new topic also brings with it a different method. Perhaps, you have heard about motivations of the participant and now would like to explore an activity: “You said you enjoy getting inspiration from browsing the web. Could you show me how you do that?”

Or you might want to talk in detail about something a participant just sketched in a diagram: “In this diagram, you mentioned that it is important to know what foods your kids like. Can you tell me more about what happens when it goes wrong?”

Again, the methods can be intertwined, so that information from one method is brought in when using another method: “Your child would be cranky if they do not like the food, and that easily messes up the schedule… let me add that to the diagram.” I then write “kids cranky:bad” in the diagram, so I can remember it.

Using different methods and switching between them may seem like additional work. However, it can make your job easier while improving the outcome —just like choosing the right tools in manual crafts.

## Wrapping up a research session

Research sessions often take place in scheduled time slots. This means you can plan ahead and start to wrap up when you have about 20 minutes left, giving you enough time to tie up loose ends, summarize your understanding and then formally close the session.

Ending the session is like starting the session, but in reverse order. Starting meant moving from the predictable to new experiences; ending a session means moving from the new experiences and learning to a formal end.

As the research session draws to a close, you will want to tie up loose threads: Consider what you could not yet make sense of. Ask the participant for what you still don’t know. Don’t be afraid to express your lack of understanding.


> Researcher: “There is one thing that I still do not understand: You mentioned you collect online recipes, but we have not talked about how you store them, to come back to the ones you like. How does this work?”

You may not be able to tie up _all_ loose ends. Focus on what is important to you on and what seems to be particularly interesting about this participant: You may be wondering about how the participants organizes recipes in general, but this participant cooks for their family on a regular basis. You haven't spoken to many participants about cooking for others, so you could focus on that aspect provided you can still learn more about organizing recipes from other participants.

A good way to guide towards the end of the session is to summarize what you have learned. This allows you to demonstrate what you and the participant have achieved together. It also gives the participant the opportunity to correct you if there are any misunderstandings.

> _Researcher_: “I see that we approach the end of our meeting time. Thanks for giving me these insights into your work. Let me summarize what I learned from you: …”

After listening to what the participant has to say about your summary and taking notes of it, thank the participant for their time and for what you learned. I also let participants know that they can contact me if they have any questions about the research itself or the use of the data and give them my email address to contact me if needed. In my experience, it is rare for participants follow up, and when they do, it’s often with helpful hints or an example for something that they could not easily explain in the research session.

> _Note:_ Oh, before you go, something very important!
> 
> In some cases, the participant might start opening up a new and interesting topic just before the end of the research session. I don’t know why this happens. Maybe it is because they considered the topic to be important but were too polite to push for it themselves and hoped that the conversation would eventually get to the topic.
>
> You could expand the session time. It is great to learn more, and it seems that the participant would like to let you know about this. However, it might also expand the time beyond what the participant gets incentivized for or what they actually planned. The best solution is usually to ask the participant openly.

## After the research session

After gathering data, we need to take care that we can use the rich data in our later analysis. To get the most out of your data, you should complement your notes, sketches, and diagrams and add some information about the context of the data gathering to fill gaps and to help you to organize the data.

There are two ways to complement your data: From memory and from audio recordings and photos.

Complementing your data should be done as soon as possible after the research session. I recommend scheduling the data gathering so that you have some time right after the session to complement your data.

### Debrief with your research partner—or alone

In the debriefing you mentally go through the research session again and note important insights or new questions. This is easier and more interesting when you are researching together with a partner since you can share your impressions with each other.

Debriefs can vary in length. I suggest scheduling at least 10 minutes, but for an interesting session, you can also fill 20 to 30 minutes.

There is no set structure for a debrief, but there are some points to pay attention to:

* What was surprising? What led you to develop your understanding?
* What was similar to previous research sessions? What matched your expectations?
* Which questions could you not answer? What are new questions that you have?
* What would you do in the next research session that builds upon these experiences?

<!-- roundtrip-->

Debriefs are helpful to get an initial structure to what you learned. They also provide closure and are a first preparation to both future research sessions with participants and analyzing the data. They have their strongest effects when done with a research partner. Aside from the advantages of exchanging and combining your experiences, they are also a great social experience that gives a sense of mutual achievement.

### Complementing data from memory

Complementing your notes, sketches, and diagrams is important: Some data may make perfect sense to you now, but since memory fades, it does not make sense anymore later. Complement and clarify your data, so you can still comprehend them after your memories of the experience are not fresh anymore.

![You quickly forget about details you heard or saw](images/03_dataGathering_MemoryFades.png){#memoryFades alt="A series of 3 sketches, illustrating forgetting; they loose more and more detail."}

> In my notes I have the line “No Milk.” This can mean many things, so I give some context here. I add to my notes:
> “Needs recipes with _No milk_
> because: milk = stomachache. Dairy free recipes: Vegan blogs as go-to-source”.

Similarly, if my writing is rather messy, I rewrite some words to ensure that I can later decipher what I wrote (See the [following figure](#correctingWritingNotes)).
I write and draw my complements in another color than the color of the original notes. When I wrote my notes during the interview with a blue pen, I use black for the complements or vice versa, since I like to keep track of what I did in which step of the process.

<!-- TODO -->
![A sheet of paper with notes that I annotated after the research session. I rewrote a word that was barely readable (“WASHED”) and added the context information that the person cooking was unsure if they could prepare the lentils quick enough before the onions were done.](images/03_dataGathering_correctNotes.png){#correctingWritingNotes alt="a crop of a sheet of paper with notes that I annotated after the research session. I rewrote a word that was barely readable (“WASHED”) and added the context information that the person cooking was unsure if they could prepare the lentils quick enough before the onions were done."}

Using different colors is useful for another type of complement: Ideas or remarks in connection to your notes. When I go through the notes, I often have some ideas for a design or a question that I would like to explore in a future interview. I write them down in a third color, or I prefix the note with “IDEA:” or “QUESTION” to prevent myself from mixing my ideas with empirical data.

### Transcribe notes

Because they are often written quickly, your notes will usually be rather incoherent: Single words, small sketches, and longer sentences will all be scattered on the paper.


![The clean transcript of the [previous figure](#correctingWritingNotes)](images/03_dataGathering_transcribedNotes.png){#cleanTranscript alt="Clean transcript. Text: Person looking at the next step in the recipe, reads silently. I ask: What do you think?→ I now need to add the washed lentils. I wonder if I can do this before the onions are done. Looks at onions: I guess that’s fine[→she can make it in time]"}

Tidy your data and transcribe the notes in a digital document. In your digital document, put one statement in each line.

Avoid tying together two separate statements on one line. This needs to be balanced with another need: Making sure that the data you put into one line is meaningful on its own and is not just a single word or a description free of any context and thus hard to set in relation to other data.

Here are notes that are too short and not meaningful on its own:


> * making space
> * shopping

If there is any way to add the actual context (from memory or by using other notes) these notes should be complemented with that context. This should help to learn why the person made space and why they went shopping. However, there can also be too much content in one line if it covers several topics at once.

> * For cooking, you need free space in the kitchen, which is often occupied by things, so you need to move stuff around to get the space you need for chopping or peeling vegetables.
> * If they can plan ahead, they go shopping on Saturdays to buy what they need for the coming week, including groceries for cooking. More often though, they go spontaneously, since the supermarket is nearby.

Too much content in each line makes it hard to analyze the data later.

In most cases, you can split lines that cover different observations or statements to multiple lines that still deliver enough content to be understood:

> * Make free space in kitchen for cooking
> * Chopping, Peeling needs free space.
> * Go shopping on Saturdays for the coming week
> * Spontaneous needs no large problem; supermarket nearby.

The notes from the research session and later added complements from my memory get the same formatting in my documents because they are all data I gathered by listening or observing the participant. But I take care that later added design ideas and research questions are still easily distinguishable from the actual data that I gathered in the research session.

### Complement from audio recordings

If you made a recording of your research session, use it to complement and check data.

When the audio contains information which is not in the document or if it complements information that is already there, pause the playback and write the additional information in the document. The process is very similar to complementing your notes from memory.

> The audio recording of participant is saying: “I’m kinda lazy, so I like to cook spontaneously and with the ingredients that are just there, you know? ”
> 
> The notes say: “cook spontaneously”
> 
> So I add the information: “cook spontaneously. Use ingredients that are there. because ‘kinda lazy’”


If you need to save time, don't listen to the full recording but go through your notes and see where they lack information. Jump to the parts of the audio that might complement these sections.

### Pseudonymize your notes

When transcribing your notes, it is also a good point in time to pseudonymize them.

Pseudonymization means that you replace identifying information like names, places, or job titles with placeholders. So, the second user you talked to, “Abigail Miller”, might become P2 (a user code) or “Anna” (a pseudonym). This also depends on the participants’ wishes—some might want to choose a pseudonym or actually appear with the name they usually use. If there is nothing else specified, I use codes.

Aside from names, there might be other data that could identify the participant, for example names of places, institutions, or job titles. If they can identify the participant, replace them with more general placeholders: “Hannover” might become “A city in the north of Germany.”

> _Note:_ If you want to know more about pseudonymization, read [“Anonymising interview data: challenges and compromise in practice”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582834/) (2014) by Saunders, Kitzinger, and Kitzinger.

You can’t make pseudonymization absolutely safe. If your research involves people who need particular protection against identification, you also might want to use a more elaborate way of pseudonymization and data protection—explaining that is beyond the aims of the book and research with vulnerable people is not a good setting to get started with user need research in the first place, anyway.

### Organize and archive your data

It should be easy to find out later which data was from which participant and how notes, sketches, diagrams, and possible audio recordings fit together.

Take care that all sheets of paper and files have the following:

* A participant code like P1 for the first, P2 for the second participant, etcetera. This way you can later trace back which data belongs together.
* The name of the project and the date. In your next or even a parallel project, you may have another “first” participant, and you don’t want to mix them up.
* The filenames (or the names of the folders they are in) should carry the participant code, project name and possibly the method too, which may lead to lengthy filenames like: LearnCooking_P3_diagram_shopping.png—“LearnCooking” being the project name, “P1” is the participant code, “diagram” is the method and “shopping” (by a client of a design) is the topic which is covered in the diagram.
* You should look for possible interconnections between different kinds of data. Maybe the participant mentioned their “messy” kitchen and you have a photo of it? Add a line in your transcript, referring to the photo. Or the participant talks about the problems of sending data to the print shop and the printing process was part of a workflow diagram you both created? Write a brief line in your notes and the diagram to connect both.

If you take these steps, you can still match project and participants later, and you don’t lose time or data because of some tangle.

As a result of these steps, you now have a transcript of your notes, diagrams, sketches, and photos with possible cross-referencing annotations, participant codes, and descriptive filenames.

### Next steps

After a few research sessions you will get the hang of it: The field you research in feels more familiar, and you can focus more on details and nuances rather than on grasping what people talk about at all. The basic steps for the research sessions however, will remain the same.

After some sessions, it makes sense to start with analysis, as your results in the analysis can inform upcoming sessions. While it is good practice to weave research sessions and analysis into each other, it might not always be possible.

## Summary

* Introduce yourself, explain how the research will be like and ask for consent.
* There are three types of gathering data: Listening, Observing and Co-Documenting.
* There are four ways of recording data: Actively with notes or sketching, passively with audio recordings and photos.
* Affirm that you listen to the participant: Nodding, saying “uhm” and referring back to what they told you. This shows that you care.
* Be open to how the participant works—don’t impose your own views.
* Delve into topics more deeply by probing, checking your understanding and asking for examples.
* Switch topics and methods to match your research interests.
* After the research session, plan for time to debrief, complementing notes and organizing data.
