#  Learning from research participants {#dataGathering}

_This chapter covers:_

* _Preparing your research sessions_
* _Observing, listening and co-documenting with research participants_
* _Capturing data for later analysis_

You've prepared your research, arranged a meeting with participants, and informed them of what to expect. Now you are ready to learn about the motivations, activities, and problems of a participant first-hand by meeting them, listening to their stories, and observing their work.

This chapter gives you guidance of how to learn best from your participant. A large part is about asking questions and guiding conversations. Often, your primary interest is what people _do_. To learn about activities, your conversation is ideally mixed with participants demonstrating their work. You take notes and pictures to help your memory. Participants can take an active role in documenting their work too: You can involve them in drawing diagrams of processes or social relations, so you co-document their work together. At the end of the research session you summarize what you learned and give the participant an opportunity to ask questions. After the session has ended, you supplement and organize your data. Only then research session is over.

<!-- TODO: compare to asking open questions again↓ -->

It is a common misconception of user research that it is about asking what people want or how much they like a feature. Your inquiry won't (directly) concern future ideas and design—you are not going to ask “do you think that [a gadget] would help you?”

It is hard to guess whether an imagined thing would be great to have in the future. Instead of working with product ideas, you find out about the how and why of our participant’s activities. This allows you to evaluate your ideas (“do my ideas match what participants consider essential for them?”) and to get inspiration for new ideas (“how can I support this activity?”).

See your participants as competent in what they do: they are experts in their fields and in their daily work. This is contrary to the idea that people “don’t get it” and need to be helped by designers and programmers. Assume that the participants have a reason of doing their work the way they do it. If you wonder about participant’s actions, try to find out their motivation for acting the way they do.

Before you learn from the participant, let's go over what you need to prepare.

## Set up the research session

To prevent any problems, prepare the research session: Send a reminder to participants and have your recording equipment ready.

### Remind participants

It can be helpful for you and your participants to send a short reminder mail to participants the day before you meet them. (If you recruit via an agency, they might do it.) Here is an example:


> Hello Sarah,
>
> I’m looking forward to meeting you tomorrow at Small Avenue 123 at 12pm. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
>
> Jan


In case you come along with a colleague who acts as a research partner, tell the participant about it, so they are not surprised to have a second person coming. Also tell the participant what your  research partner’s name and pronouns are, so participants can address them properly.

### Prepare your note-taking and recording equipment

You should also check that you have your recording equipment ready. This is what I usually bring along for in-person meetings:

* *Printed Cheat sheet* (I described [how to write a cheat sheet](#cheatsheet) in a previous section)
* *Paper on clipboard*: You might need to write on your lap or when standing.
* *Writing utensils*: Whatever you like to use. If you want to sketch or diagram with the participants, take some felt pens in black, red, and green along.
* *Audio Recorder*: A simple device for about 50€ is sufficient. It should connect to your computer via USB or take micro SD cards, so you can easily play the files on your computer. More expensive models, like a _Zoom H2_, have a higher audio quality. You can also record with your mobile phone if the quality is fine for you. Test it before in an environment similar to where you will have the research session.

If you meet online, the tools are different. In this situation, you should have the following prepared:

* *Video-conferencing app*: There are many of them. Which you choose depends on your organization, possible legal restrictions (like [GDPR](#protectionIdentity)) and participant preferences.
* *Headset*: Often has better sound quality than the built-in mic. If you want or need to use your built-in microphone, check how audible keystrokes and mouse clicks are—on some devices they will drown out any other sound!
* *Printed cheat-sheet*: Analog, but opening it on your computer would take away screen space you might want to use for the videochat and notes.
* *Writing on paper or computer*: Both writing in a text file or writing on paper is fine. If you can touch-type, you can write notes and look at the camera.
* *Whiteboarding-app*: A remote equivalent to pens and sheets of paper for collaborative activities with participants are white-boarding apps like miro, mural or tldraw. They have greatly improved in the last years but the ease-of-use of pen and paper is still unmatched—your mileage might vary, particularly with not tech-savvy participants.

### Brief your research partner

If you research together with a research partner, you should have a conversation about what you are going to do in the research session, how you want to share tasks, and what you both should be aware of. Your research partner should also know when and where you are going to meet for the research session itself and whether they should bring equipment along.

It is common for research partners to be new to user research but curious about it. When your research partner does not have experience with user research, it is best for them to start with supporting tasks like taking notes. In a [later section](#captureData) I explain how to take notes, sketch, and make photos and audio recordings. It is also good to show an example of notes from previous research to your research partner. It might be unusual for them to make detailed notes rather than summarizing strongly. For example, they will only write “Likes the software” when the participant talks for a couple of minutes how they like to use a software. An example easily shows what you think the notes should be like.

When your research partner gathers more experience, they might take a more active role from time to time. If you think that your research partner can and should ask questions to the participant, tell your research partner—otherwise they might not do it. When the research partner takes an active role, you need to take the notes.

## How to begin the research session

When you arrive at the site you do the research at, greet the participant and take care the both you and your co-researcher (if present) are introduced to the participant. Usually, a short bit of small talk will follow. This is pretty normal and it usually happens intuitively. It helps to build trust and gets used to the research situation. But after a brief time both you and your participant will want to get started with your research session proper: _“So… I’m happy that we can do this and that you could free some time for showing and telling me about your experiences with cooking and using online recipes.”_

Give some context of why that is interesting to you: _“We think about improving the usefulness of the recipes we present to people. We have some enthusiasts in our community, but also many people who do not consider themselves super skilled in cooking and we wonder what we could do for them.”_

Make clear that you are here to learn—and not an evaluator of the quality of the participant’s work: _“…this is why we would like to learn more about how you cook and how you use recipes or videos for it. Even in case you do not consider an expert cook, you certainly are the person who knows their kitchen and taste best and how you can cater to what you need. So, this is not some kind of test of skill: We want to get to know better whatever you do.”_

Although you may have described the time frame and the method already when recruiting the participant, tell them again what you are going to do: _“We will have a conversation about your work and I'll be asking some questions. In addition, I’m interested in watching you when you cook. This is, as we talked when we had contact via mail why we came a bit before the usual time you prepare your meal. The whole process will take about an hour.”_

In case they did not already agree to the consent form via mail, you can use a written consent form and narrate along its structure.

The participant must know how you record data and who will see it, even if they already agreed to recording before via mail. So tell the participant: _“I'd like to take notes, and, in addition, record audio—if that is OK with you. The audio recording helps me to focus on your work, so I don’t need to focus as much on writing notes, if I have the recording as backup. A colleague and I will listen to the audio for transcription; We will anonymize the transcribed data before we share it with the product design team. If you feel uncomfortable with being recorded at any time, we can pause or stop the recording.”_

It rarely happens that someone does not agree to being recorded. If that happens to you, you can ask politely if they have any specific worries—possibly you can inform them about that specific aspect, and they might agree when they have additional information.


> This is an example form an in-house research project, where I visited a programmer from another department in a larger company. After explaining the process the participant said this:
>
> _Participant_: “Audio recording… I’m not sure about this…”
>
> _Researcher_: “That’s fine with me. Though, may I ask what worries are?”
>
> _Participant_: “Hmm… yeah, aren't you from human resources?
>
> _Researcher_: “I understand your concern. It is fine if you don’t agree, but I can assure you that Human Resources is a separate department. We are internal tools, that is we help to improve the applications you are using for your work.
>
> We don’t share personal data and what we record today is not accessible to them. Also, all data that leaves my computer or the one of my colleague is  anonymized and we remove all data that points to you as person, including the names, workplace and so on.”
>
> _Participant_: “Oh, sure, them… I just assumed you were from HR and this I would not have liked, you know, with the recording.”
>
> It could have happened that the concerns of the participant were not resolved by me clarifying that I am not from Human Resources. If they were still fine with the research, but not with the recording—so be it. We would have taken notes instead: It’s their choice.

It goes without saying that it is important that you accommodate the participant’s wishes and respect their agency. There can be situations in which, for example, the participant is hesitant to answer or looks uneasy, possibly because of a question or a request of yours. Do not push them if they seem uncomfortable, even if you want to hear their answer. Offer them a way out of such situations, if you unintentionally caused one. You can, for example suggest an alternative task, or say that it is fine not to answer and go to the next question. The well-being of the participant is your primary concern.

Now you and the participant are ready to move into the conversation on the topics you want to learn about. For this, it’s helpful to consider in which ways you can learn from participants.

## Ways to learn from participants

You can engage with participants in different ways like listening, observing and co-documenting their activities. Each way has its own strengths, and provides insight into different aspects, so it's common to combine multiple ways.

### Listening and asking questions

A common way to learn from participants is by asking questions and listening to the participant’s answers. For understanding participants, you aim rich, story-like descriptions, telling about the user’s motivations, activities, and their context. To encourage the participant to give such story-like answers, you often need to ask for descriptions of activities and the reasons for doing them. So your questions will be like this: “Can you tell my why you went for this recipe” or “You said you will brown the onions—how do you do that?”

Asking questions and getting answers from a participant is a very versatile tool. It can be done without many resources. Furthermore, you are not tied to a specific place, and you can talk about past events as well as future plans.

But because of this, it can happen that you hardly focus on actual experiences and instead talk about abstract events. Observations are thus a good supplement to asking questions and listening.

### Observing

Listening to what people say might not be the best way to understand what they do. Just like a picture can be worth a thousand words, it makes often sense to ask participants to show what they mean and to demonstrate how they work. It can also be easier than describing the activitiy.

When you observe, you can notice things your participants would never consider mentioning: It may have gotten second nature for them which tools they use, how they apply these tools to their work and which problems they meet. But you can observe it. You also can learn about the context of their work, like means of communicating with co-workers or cues in the environment that point out problems—for example quick fixes on devices using tape and cardboard, or added instructions on machines.

![A coffee machine with added instructions on a yellow note, telling that the buttons are for “Full Cup”, “Half Cup”, “Espresso”](images/03_dataGathering_coffeeMachineUserChanges.jpg)

It is not necessary to have observation as a separate step in the research process. It is best to interweave observation with asking questions and listening. For example, you can ask for a demonstration instead of a description:\
_Participant_: _“So, as I have the recipe opened here, and read through the list of things I need, I would now start getting out the ingredients”_\
_Researcher_: “Great—if it’s fine with you, let’s actually do that!”

Think of yourself as an apprentice of the participant. The participant is the expert who can teach you some of their skills. This means that understanding the user by observing is not a passive process. Like an apprentice, you can and should ask questions. You can, for example, _ask about reasons_: “You did measure the weight of the flour on the scale, but the for the water you just used the cup. Why?” +
Or you can _ask about things you notice in the environment_: “You have much space here in the kitchen, are there certain things you do at specific places?”

Teaching an apprentice is not a theoretical or artificially set up process: The tasks you observe should be tasks that the participant is actually doing (and not something set up for you). Imagine you are asked:\
_Participant_: “What should I do now?”, you reply with \
_Researcher_: “What would you do if I would not be here?”

Of course, what you observe should be relevant to _your_ interests as well. The conversation could continue in this way:\
 _Participant_:“I would either start to make this stir-fry vegetables, or actually, only heat something up for lunch and rather make some apple crumble for dessert”\
 _Researcher_: “If you have no preferences, I would be curious to see you making the apple crumble—I have not seen how people make dessert in our research!”


From time to time, you might observe actions that seem to be wrong or at least not optimal: People might seem to ignore a feature that could make them a lot more efficient or they just never use a product on which you focus your research interests. In such situations, it’s important to stay curious rather than being judgmental. If you start judging and even possibly “correcting” their practices, you close your mind to the reasons for the participant’s actions. Also, your participant would stop being open about showing you how they work. Participants are experts in their work and  have a reason for doing what they do. Maybe they do not want to be more effective because it would mean that their superiors would increase expectations, leaving no wiggle room for everyday contingencies. Maybe they don’t use a product because it’s indeed important in a work process but people have found ways to prevent a situation from happening that triggers this process.

### Co-documenting {#coDocumenting}

When listening or observing, the data is created with the participants, but somewhat passively: You try to capture what happens in notes and recordings. But you can also document their work with the participant directly. I call this _co-documenting_ because both you and the participant document an aspect of the participant’s life directly by drawing and writing. This can be as simple as asking the participant: _“Draw the layout of your kitchen. Please mark what is important to your work and write why!”_

Here are examples of co-documenting results. Most of them are based on a template that guides the participant.

To document the context of the participant, you can use a social space map as shown in the [following figure](#socialNetworkDiagramExample). The participant is in the center and they who is relevant for them. Many participants do not limit themselves to people and might add institutions, roles or technologies, that matter for them, too. 

![The participant is in the center. They draw people (or whatever else they think matters) around them and write the nature of the connection on the arrows.](images/03_dataGathering_socialNetworkDiagramExample.png){#socialNetworkDiagramExample alt="A diagram where a research participant drew connections relevant for their cooking: Utensils, YouTube, flatmates"}


The timeline-diagram in the next figure is great to get an overview of what parts of a longer process participants like or dislike.

![If the graph goes up, the mood gets better, if it goes down, the participant feels bad, bored or annoyed.](images/03_dataGathering_timelineDiagramExample.png){#timelineDiagramExample alt="A diagram where a research participant indicated their mood during recipe selection and cooking"}

The timeline-diagram usually covers a longer process of time in a birds-eye-view. Often you also want to know details of a process. For this, you can use a recipe-like list of steps, as shown the next figure:

![A recipe-like overview with sketches to show how to cook coffee.](images/03_dataGathering_stepDiagramExample.png){#stepDiagramExample alt="A recipe-like overview with sketches to show how to cook coffee"}

Having the documentation in front of you and the participant makes it easy to improve it while it is being created. You, the researcher, can refer to it to ask for elaboration (“Is this the cupboard where you keep the ingredients?”).

The fact that researcher and participant both need to understand the documentation is a check against unclear terms, vague references, and sloppy handwriting. This makes the results accessible and useful.

A situation in which this is relevant could happen like this:\
_Researcher_: “The line here seems to indicate that you were very happy at the beginning…”\
_Participant_: “Yes, the recipe just looked awesome, I really wanted to try it”\
_Researcher_: “Can you write this in the diagram, so I can understand it later?” \
_Participant_: [Writes as comment in the diagram] “Recipe looks awesome!” \

Whether researcher or participant does the drawing, writing, or both depends on what is more practical and gives more interesting data. When researching workflows, _I_ write the documentation as a researcher, because participants should be able to demonstrate their tasks directly, which is hard when you need to switch between demonstrating and writing all the time. When the participants document a project on a timeline, _they_ draw it directly, and I only ask questions.

For some participants, documenting their work by drawing and writing can be a bit unusual. It can help to show a simple example of what the result of a co-documentation can look like. It can also reduce anxiety in drawing related tasks—some people assume they need to produce an artwork. Showing that a rough sketch is fine helps them to get started.

> _Tip:_ Try to create some diagrams about _your_ work to get a feeling for it. Pick an activity and choose a diagram to document this activity. Review the result: What could it tell another person about that activity? What does it not tell? Try another diagram type for the same activity: Where do both diagrams convey the same information? Where do they differ?

It can be easier for the participant if you provide a template instead of a blank page: This gives a basic structure. Provide fields for name, date, title, and some space for the participant’s diagram. I also sometimes print a small example in a corner of the template. The following figure is an example for a template that I use for timeline diagrams. Templates work very well for chart-like types of diagrams, since the participant can draw on top of elements that are already there, like the diagrams’ axis.

![Example template for mood-timeline-diagrams.](images/03_dataGathering_templateGoodBadTime.png){#templateGoodBadTime alt="A template for a mood-timeline diagram: A horizontal time arrow, and a vertical axis with a smiley (top/up) and a frowning face (bottom/down)"}

Co-documentation works well in combination with interviewing and observation: You can co-document workflows combined with observing the workflows and you can also go from an interview to co-documenting a specific aspect (“That is interesting! I would like to remember it clearly later on, so I would like to write the steps down with you”) or use a documentation to refer back to in an interview (“You wrote… How does relate to…”) and add further details to it.

Co-documenting via lists, diagrams, and drawings may seem unusual in the beginning. But they produce very useful and graspable data by having the researcher and the participant work together. The participant’s active part in documenting and the possibility to see directly what is recorded can empower participants: They do not only actively show and tell but also take part in recording.


## Ways to capture data {#captureData}

Without recording data, you need to rely on memorizing what you learn. As there is a lot to learn from participants, it makes sense to support your memory using media to record data. How you record data is strongly connected to how you engage with the participant: If you focus on a conversation you need to record in another way than when you observe a work process in which you see a lot of actions but have few verbal hints from the participant. The conversation lends itself to notes and audio recording, the work process to sketches, diagrams and maybe even short film clips. However, there is not a 1:1 match of a way to learn from participants and ways to record data: Sometimes a verbal description is helpful for an action focused activity, some people might record a conversation in a more diagram-like form to see central objects and conflicts.

When you have a research partner with you, it is a common division of work that the research partner focuses on the recording. Whether the research partner does only focus on recording depends on their preference and skills. If they like to and have basic skills in engaging with participants, it can be helpful if they can chime in and ask for clarifications or repeating a process to understand it better since they might notice gaps in the data they record.

Even if you have a research partner who will take care of the recording, you should be familiar with the equipment. It can happen that they are late or get sick, so you need to record the data yourself. Also, if you have the chance to work with an experienced researcher, you might be in the role of the research partner and focus on recording.

### Notes and sketches

While you observe or listen to the participant, you take brief notes. This is rather like taking notes in school or university: You go for the gist of what was said as detailed as possible, but you don’t write down the exact words (Except in the case you find a particular expression itself important). One utterance or observation concerning one topic goes in one line, bullet-point style.

When you look down at your notes and think about what to write, listening and observing don’t work well. Try to keep it as unobtrusive as possible. If you don’t care too much about your handwriting you can write notes without much looking at the paper except for some occasional glances. When you do the meeting remotely you can do notes by handwriting as well or use your computer. Just check for keyboard noises—they can be annoying even if you use a microphone. 

Because of the difficulties of balancing observing, listening and note-taking, there are obvious benefits of a partner who does the research with you. One person can ask questions and guide through the research, the other person takes notes. Both observe and listen.

![Notes from a research session](images/03_dataGathering_notesExample1.png){#notesExample1 alt="Interview and Observation notes. They are not very tidy; they are combined with little sketches"}

If you record audio in parallel, you can be more relaxed when writing what was said. However, you still need to take notes to retain what you observed. This can also be very useful when you listen to the audio later and wonder what was referred to when the participant refers to things as “it” and “that”; without notes it can be hard to reconstruct what the participant was talking about. In the [previous example notes](#notesExample1), I used little sketches to record what the participant was doing.

When I take notes in research, I often write about 1 page every 15 minutes. The notes of a typical session won’t fit a single page or on the margins of your cheat sheet.

You supplement, transcribe, and analyze your notes after the data gathering. Between collecting the data and reviewing your notes, you easily forget the context.

For example, if you observe that someone tastes a bit and then adds a small amount of sugar, you might just write “sugar”. It might make totally sense at the moment you write it, since you are watching what is happening and you know what happened before and after. But without this implicit knowledge of context, the line “sugar” does not make much sense. Writing something like “Tastes → Adds a bit sugar” instead helps to interpret your notes later.

The observations you make are visual and concerned with processes. A good way to support your memory of observations is creating sketches or small process diagrams.

![A small sketch from my notes, showing where a participant did what](images/03_dataGathering_sketchExample1.png){#sketchExample1 alt="Sketch of washing, chopping, cooking at their respective places"}

It is not important that your sketches look realistic. Realism is better done by cameras. Use it to your advantage that sketches are different from photos: Draw important things bigger, leave out what is irrelevant and make annotations with arrows and notes to understand what was going on.

### Taking photos

Tanking photos is rather easy and can capture a lot of information. For example, you can photograph the participant’s kitchen to aid your memory. Later, you can go back to the photo when you read your notes. Where was their fridge, where was the stove? Where did they put used utensils and cutting boards? 

You can also photograph screens of computers and gadgets if you have the participant’s consent to do this. A software-based screenshot might, in theory, be superior—but if the user does not know how to take a screenshot, a camera is a handy way to capture the screen.

You should be able to take photos with your camera or phone quickly and reliably. Use a device you know. The only setting that I use is the exposure compensation. This function is useful when the automatic setting for exposure fails you and an important part of the image is totally dark or disappears in light. Exposure compensation allows adjusting for that.

### Recording audio

I recommend using audio recordings—it is a useful supplement to your notes. Using audio recording, you can listen to what was said in the research session. Note, that it is not a perfect capture of all that happened: If the participant points to an ingredient or utensil and refers to “this”, the recording is not much of help. People use such expressions a lot when they talk about activities, so you need your notes to supplement the audio.

Photography and audio recording supplement note-taking and sketching well. They are, however, not superior to manual recordings: They are different, and these difference can be used by you to combine their strengths.


## Assure and encourage

At the beginning of the research session, the participant might feel insecure. Most people do not have experience being a research participant, so they might be concerned of doing something wrong or unhelpful. For both making the participant feel well and for the research leading to helpful results, it is important to support the participant and to show them that you are interested in their work and explanations.

### Affirm that you listen

You ask questions aiming for descriptions and longer answers. So you _listen_ to the participant most of the time. You probably have some ways to intuitively show that you listen—like nodding with the head or saying “yes” or “mm-mhh.” This is an important way to ensure the participant that you listen to what they say.

Asking follow-up questions also shows that you take interest in what they do. Follow-up questions can concern topics the participant mentioned or workflows that they demonstrated. You can also summarize what you heard and saw: “So, you said that…”. Thus, you can check your understanding and show that you listened well—without casting judgment on what was told.

Some participants might assume that you can’t learn anything from them because they assume you to have knowledge about their work already. For example, if you are from the company that created a product they use, they might assume that you know all about it and what possibly could be done with it. Even if you know the product well, you probably don’t know how it is used by people in practice and what its limits are. You can tell them something like this: “Thanks, it can seem this way, but I only create a small part of (Product) and I am not an expert in (whatever the product is used for). I think I can learn a lot about how (product) is actually used in the real world!”

### Make a friendly impression by using body language.

Probably, you would not make a bad impression anyway, but let’s go through it nevertheless: Don’t give an angry or stern impression by frowning and crossing arms and legs. Don’t look careless by leaning back and looking to the ceiling. During the interview, show reactions to what the participant says or does. If you take notes, maintaining eye contact is not possible all the time—but keep eye contact when you can.

## Be open to how the participant works and thinks

In user need research you want to learn from participants. This is exciting since you can’t know what you will learn. The things you learn unexpectedly are often crucial to further developing your understanding of the participants and to recognize potential risks and opportunities. However, being open to these experiences is not easy. Not knowing what you learn is unsettling. In our everyday life, we often trade the openness for efficiency and known outcomes. To stay open to how the participant works and thinks is a skill that must be learned—but there are some basic principles that can be of great help: Asking open questions, not suggesting answers, and embracing the value of silence.

### Ask open questions

Open questions are questions that do prompt longer, descriptive answers. You already read about open questions in the [section on writing your research session questions](#prepareResearch): Open questions are questions that invite longer, descriptive answers from participants—in contrast to closed questions, which have only a closed range of meaningful answers. Asking participants open questions will lead to concrete and descriptive answers and potentially lead to insights that you did not expect.

I pick up the topic here again, because only a part of the questions you ask will be questions you wrote down before. You might also come up with questions reacting to what you hear or see when being with the participant. It often makes sense to ask these questions as open questions, too.

To be able to come up with open questions during the conversation, it can be helpful to have some easy-to-memorize phrases that help to ask open questions:

* Starting your questions with “Can you tell me more about…” invites descriptive, longer answers: “Can you tell me more about why it is difficult to cook for a large family?”
* Asking “How”-Questions invite the description or demonstration of activities: “How do you go about choosing recipes” or “How did you learn what ‘glacing’ meant?”

These phrases are useful for asking open questions. There are also phrases you might want to avoid as they usually start closed questions.

When being concerned with developing products it is rather tempting to ask “would you…” questions, like “Would you like to bookmark recipes?” Such questions are problematic for two reasons:

* They ask the participant to make guesses about their future decisions, which is not very reliable.
* They often invite only short answers like “yes” or “No”, like “Yes, bookmarks sound good.”

“Is” is another word that often leads to closed questions that are answered with “yes” or “no”: “Is it difficult to cook a risotto?”—“No, not really.”

> _Tip:_ Sometimes closed questions can be a springboard to open questions. “Would you like to bookmark recipes?” points to a relevant activity: About re-finding and organizing recipes. An open question based on this could be “How do you look up recipes again which you liked in the past?”

By using phrases like “Can you tell me more” or “How do you…” you can ask open questions in reaction to what participants say or do. While sometimes, closed questions are helpful, often they are not. Rephrasing closed “Would you” and “Is…” questions can help you to get more interesting answers.



### Do not suggest “right” or “wrong” answers or processes {#rightAnswers}

A frequent concern of researchers is influencing the participants. One way to deal with this concern is defining how questions should be asked by following a strict script.

But creating artificially constant conditions would make you lose the very strengths of the methods described here: Being able to find out about new and unexpected things, reacting to them and gaining understanding of the how-and-why by reacting on the situation. Each participant and their context is different. You can accommodate this by adjusting the research session to the context and the activities of the participant. This would not be possible when asking the same questions each time. Being flexible and able to react to situations is essential and a strength of the research method.

What I think is relevant though, is considering how your own assumptions and wishes can lead to suggesting favorable answers. Such influence in research comes in different shapes: “This is good, isn’t it?!” Is a very obvious influence, since it blatantly states what you think the answer should be: A “yes.”

There are less obvious influences as well, for example suggesting via saying “Would you like a better version of this?”—who would not like something better, so again, the answer the participant is going to give is “yes”.

Aside from your questions, you could also suggest “right” ways of doing something with direct feedback. For example, when a participant says “I can’t read the recipes on the website, and there is no mobile view that makes them readable”, it may be tempting to say: “No, there is!” if that function is actually there, but the participant did not notice it.

Remember, that you want to find out what your participant does and why. To correct the participant immediately rarely leads to new insights.  Instead, you can just ask “what do you do then?”, or, if talking about the function itself is important to you, you can ask “What is an example for a website that does it better?”

This being said, if you can clearly help the participant with a simple bit of information, explore the topic and share your knowledge immediately after —while not “correcting” the participant: “This was very helpful for me to learn! The team that build the website will appreciate learning about the problems. What they have assumed is that people trigger the mobile view by…”

You may also be surprised or even annoyed by steps or actions in a workflow of the user that seem outright superfluous.\
 _Participant_: “When I want to share a recipe, I make a photo of the screen like this… and then I can forward the image in a chat” \
You may think that this is rather inefficient and be tempted to say “Why don’t you use the share-function or copy the web address?—that would be far more efficient!”

Remember that nobody does inefficient actions by purpose. Assume that the participant has a reason. Try to find out what this reason may be.

Again, you could ask: “What’s the reason for you to do it this way?”—and ask follow-up questions to further explore the issue. For example, they might prefer images as they show directly in chats and can easily be tapped to zoom in, whereas the original website would open in another app.

Don’t be afraid to react toward the participant and what they say or do. Adapting to the situation is essential in our research. But don’t judge the actions or answers of a participant. You are interested in the how and why of their work. If you judging what they do prematurely cuts off questions to be explored.

## Silence feels strange, but it’s okay

Sometimes, the participant takes time to think before answering. Intuitively, you may want to fill the silence to help the participant along.

> _Researcher_: “Can you tell me what happened after you added the pepper to the dish?”\
> (pause) “…was it fine?”
> 
> _Participant_: “Yeah, I think”

It is tempting to fill the silence with suggestions for the answer. But it can turn an open question (“can you describe…?”) into a closed question (“can you describe… was it…?”) or prevent the participant coming up with their answer on their own.

Try to tolerate the silence. Usually, the participant answers within a few seconds. If you notice silence which you want to fill, count to three or five before probing further. Then, ask about the question rather than giving suggestions, like “What makes the question hard to answer?” or “Can you tell me what you are thinking about?”

This way, you can help the participant to continue with elaborating on the question you asked, even if they need some thinking to answer it.

## Take a closer look

Initially, you gain some familiarity with the participant and what they do. Previously, you knew some terms and what they describe. Now you want to get to learning how it all connects, understand what the participant deems to be relevant and why, and to see and experience easily glossed-over tacit knowledge of activities and skills. 

When that topic seems relevant for your research, you should try to get to learn more: You can probe with follow-up-questions, check your understanding, and ask for demonstrations.

### Probing

When I learn something new, I often feel that this is only the beginning of a bigger topic. In this case I can “probe” for further information.

You already know one way to do this: Silence. Just as you might intuitively want to fill the silence, the participant may just jump in and fill the silence with further information.


> _Participant_: “So I found that recipe and I tried it once, but it was so-so”\
> (Brief pause, researcher nods)
> 
> _Participant_: “I don’t know what the problem was, I guess something about the timing. Everything was just mushy,”



If leaving a pause does not make sense, you can achieve a similar outcome by repeating the most recent statement or words the participant has said.


> _Participant_: “So I found that recipe and I tried it once, but it was so-so”
> 
> _Researcher_: “So-so?”
> 
> _Participant_:“I don’t know what the problem was, I guess something about the timing. Everything was just mushy,”

This way, you can help participants to carry on without changing the course by asking new questions.

If you would like to know more about something particular, you can also ask directly: “Please tell me what you would do in a situation requiring you to wait?”

Asking directly can be useful if the participant gave a rather vague answer:

> _Participant_: “Well, I try to get some more information and try to find out where it got stuck”
> 
> _Researcher_: “Could you describe me how you would do that?”


When you gather your data by observing or drawing diagrams with the participant, direct questions are very useful to explore the work.

> _Researcher_: “You added pepper without tasting before or checking the recipe—how did you know it needed pepper?”
> 
> Or, when co-documenting with the participant in a diagram:
> 
> _Researcher_: “This graph seems to indicate you were in quite a good mood here. Could you explain me a bit why you seem to be less happy here [Points]?”

By using these methods, you can get additional information and show the participant that you are carefully listening and observing. Following up on observations and information is important to learn new things. However, sometimes you rather need to check your understanding. Even if it all makes sense to you, let’s ask the participant if your understanding makes sense to them.

### Check your understanding

To check my understanding I often refer back to what the participant talked about earlier or what they demonstrated to me. I tell them how I interpret a situation based on what I learned from them and ask them if it makes sense to them. In this case, even closed (yes/no) questions are okay.

> _Researcher_: “You said that it looks good, now. Did you mean the pasta is done now…?”
> 
> _Participant_: “No, the sauce. It looks good, just like on the picture at the recipe.”

There are several advantages of checking:

* Avoid confusions and misinterpreted research due to misunderstandings.
* Show that you care for the participant’s expertise.
* Encourage participants to continue and tell you more.

For checking, you need to refer to something that you want to check. You often need to describe it to the participant:


> _Researcher_: “So: If I want to cook something you would first see which ingredients you have and then try to match a recipe?”
> 
> _Participant_: “Yes… I mean, somewhat. It plays a role. I do not want stuff go to waste.”


To refer to what you learned some time earlier, you and the participant need to remember. Use your notes as memory aid, and don’t be afraid to just point at things if you do not remember the correct term. The participant tells you what the “thingy” is called by them. For example, you could ask: “Can you tell me more about this does?” (points at a utensil)? Or when co-documenting: “Here (Points to diagram) your motivation seemed to change quite quickly—can you tell me more about this?”

By checking your interpretations of the participants descriptions and activities, you can avoid misunderstandings and gain additional insights.

### Ask for examples

When participants mention activities or tools they use, ask them if you could observe the activity or tool in action. Seeing an example avoids misunderstandings and gives rich opportunities for further insights:

> _Participant_: “…so I would just use the food processor to do it.”
> 
> _Researcher_: “Can you show me how you do that?”


This avoids ambiguity in what they meant by “using.” It is easiest for researcher and participant to look at it together.

You can also ask for examples to delve deeper into a topic. The participant might have mentioned a process earlier. You now could ask to learn more about it:

> _Researcher_: “You said you would look up on YouTube how to cut this. Can you show me how you do that?”
> 
> Or, without asking for a demonstration:\
> _Researcher_: “…what would you expect to find?”


Asking for examples provides a natural way to show your interest, expand topics and to switch from a conversation to observation. Switching methods and topics in your research is important to get to know what is relevant for you, and this is what we are looking at in the next section.

> #### We have already build something, why don’t we use it?!
> 
> 
> When discussing [project types in the first chapter](#projectTypes), I wrote that user need research should be done early in projects. Often, however, people have already started designing something, for example a prototype or concept document, and they will ask you if you can’t make this part of your research. You can, but some caveats apply.
> 
> When bringing in an idea or prototype, you should steer the conversation towards how the participant assumes it will affect them. Do not focus on whether they like it or if they find it useful. Focus on what it makes them think about.
> 
> I introduce such ideas or prototypes by saying something like: “There are always many ideas floating around. A colleague said they think about…” This way, I lower the risk that the participant assumes that I am sold on the idea and that I want a confirmation rather than learning from them.
> 
> Then I will show them the prototype or the idea. Sometimes it is working interface, sometimes a competitor’s tool, sometimes just some sketches or diagrams. But keep it simple—the core of it should fit on one screen or printout, otherwise you just create confusion.
> 
> After having introduced the prototype or idea, focus your questions on what the participant assumes its effects would have on their daily life. You could say: “How do you think would this fit into your work?” or “We do not know enough about your field of work, so we wondered what the effect of such a product would be.” In case participants are hesitant, it can also help to ask what they think _other people_ would think: “What would your [peers/team/family…] think about using this?”
> 
> The participant’s answer helps you to learn about their motivations, activities, and problems. For example, they might tell you: “Yeah, this idea comes up again and again, but such products I know were not used. Just doing it by browsing takes time but it is fun. I do not want to make recipe selection more efficient!” or they tell you “I currently use google docs for this and just mention people there. But I struggle with getting an overview of all the feedback I got and I sometimes wish for more organization there.” You can then explore the topics deeper and ask: “Can you show me how your process works in google docs?”
> 
> I also had people outright dismissing or being indifferent to what I showed. They could easily tell why. This is actually great, as it prevents wasting more time and money on an idea.
> 
> When you use prototypes or ideas in your research, it should be clear to your colleagues that you do this to learn more about the _participant’s work_. When people ask you to “evaluate the concept” or “test the prototype” they do want to learn about the _concept_ or _prototype_ and should rather do a usability test.
> 
> Introducing existing ideas and prototypes can help you to learn more about participants and the context that affect possible plans for the future. This can only work successfully if you and your colleagues are on the same side and know that the focus is learning about the participant, not about the idea or prototype itself.


## Steer the course of research

A research session follows a structure: Like in a movie, you get to know the world and the protagonists before you delve deeper into core issues. At the end you try to wrap up loose ends and summarize what you learned. To navigate you and the participant smoothly from start to end of the interview you need to provide guidance by switching topics and switching methods.

### Switch topics

Over the course of your research, you cover different topics. You might set some topics beforehand because you think they are important. To use the time efficiently and learn about the topics relevant to you, you sometimes need to nudge the participant in the direction that is interesting for you.

You might want to switch topics when:

* There is (seemingly) nothing more to be found out.
* You covered enough and need to switch to another topic before time runs out (If this happens, plan in more time in the future)
* The participant is focusing on a topic that is not in the focus of your research.

To switch topics, you can voice your interest in the next topic: “Could you tell me more about recipes that you use frequently?”

If possible, you can end the block by rephrasing what you learned before moving to the next topic: “Let me briefly summarize: […]. So, what would be interesting for me as well: You said you have recipes that you go back to again and again—can you tell me about this?”

This can be particularly useful if a participant is carried away by a topic that is not relevant for you.: “…there is another topic is important to me: You said you have recipes that you go back to again and again—can you tell me about this?”

To make the topic changes less abrupt, and to show that you listened carefully, you can refer to a topic which was mentioned, but not yet explored : “In the diagram you mentioned that you would ask your mom about cooking—what is it you ask her?” or “You mentioned that you sometimes prefer printed recipes on paper. What is useful about them?”

By altering the topic, you can cover the issues you need to know about and, if needed, bring your research back on course. But sometimes, you do not want to switch topics, but change the way you engage with the topic.

### Switch methods

Every method highlights different aspects of the participant’s motivations, activities, and problems. So it makes sense to transition between methods in your research. By using different methods on the same topic, you can gain new perspectives on it.


> (Here is a possible switch from interview to observation)\
> _Researcher_: “You told me your general process of cooking a meal. Do you think we could cook something now, so I get to see it in practice?”
> 
> In this case, you already have a description of the activity. By observing the process, you can gain a less abstract, more specific and contextual view on it.

The methods you use on the same topic can be intertwined: During the demonstration of the activity, the participant may add to their description. For example, the participant explains while demonstrating: “I did not mention this before—I add some annotations to the recipes, in case I found some variant that I like or which is useful.”

Often, a new topic also brings a different method. You may have heard about motivations of the participant and now would like to explore an activity: “You said that collecting inspiration on the web is fun for you. Could you show me how you do that?”

Or you might want to talk in depth about something that a participant just sketched in a diagram: “In this diagram, you mentioned that it is important to know  which food your kids like. Can you tell me more about what happens when it goes wrong?”

Again, the methods can be intertwined, so that information from one kind of method is brought in when using another method: “So, your kid would be cranky if they do not like the food, and that easily messes up the schedule… let me add that to the diagram.” I then would write “kids cranky:bad” here in the diagram, so I can remember it.

Using different methods and switching between them may seem like additional work. However, it can ease your work and, at the same time, improve its outcomes—just like choosing the right tools in manual crafts.

## Wrapping up a research session

Research sessions often happen in set time slots. This means you can plan ahead and start to wrap up when you still have about 20 minutes left, giving you enough time to tie up loose threads, summarize your understanding and then formally close the session.

Wrapping up the session is like starting the session, but in reverse order. Starting meant going from the formal and predictable to new experiences and learning; finishing a research session means going from the new experiences and learning to a formal end.

When research session is about to end soon, you want to tie up loose threads: Consider what you could not yet make sense of. Ask the participant for what you still don’t know. Don’t be afraid to voice your lack of understanding.


> Researcher: “There is one thing that I do not understand yet: You mentioned you collect online recipes, but we did not talk about how you store them so you can get back to ones that you liked. How does that work?”

You might not be able to tie up _all_ loose ends. Focus on what is important to you on one hand and what seems to be interesting about this participant in particular: You might wonder about how the participants organizes recipes in general, but this participant regularly cooks for their family. You did not talk about cooking for others with a lot of participants yet, so you might focus on this aspect, assuming that you can still learn more about recipe organization from other participants.

A good way to guide toward the end of the session is to summarize what you learned. This way, you can account for what you and the participant accomplished together. It also gives the participant the opportunity to correct you in case there are any gross misunderstandings.

> _Researcher_: “I see that we approach the end of our meeting time. Thanks for giving me insight in your work. Let me summarize what I learned from you: …”


After listening to what the participant has to say about your summary and making notes of it, thank the participant for their time and for what you learned again. I also let participants know that they can contact me if they have any questions about the research itself or how the data will be used and pass them my email address for reaching out. In my experience, it rarely happens that participants follow up, and in the cases it happens it’s often with helpful hints or an example for something that they could not explain easily in the research session.

> _Note:_ Oh, before you go, something very important!
> 
> In some cases the participant might start opening up a new and interesting topic just before the end of the research session. I don’t know why that happens. Maybe it is because they consider the topic to be important but were too polite to push for it themselves and hoped that the conversation would touch the topic some point.
> You could extend the session. It is great to learn more and it seems that the participant would like to let you know about this. However, it might also prolong the time beyond what the participant gets incentivized for or what they actually planned. The best solution is usually to ask the participant openly.

## After the research session

After gathering data, we need to take care that we can use the rich data in our later analysis. To make the most of your data, you should supplement our notes, sketches, and diagrams and add some information about the context of the data gathering to close gaps and to help us to keep all the data organized.

There are two ways to supplement your data: From memory and from audio recordings and photos.

Supplementing your data should be done as soon as possible after the research session. I recommend scheduling the data gathering in a way that you have some time directly after the session to supplement your data.

### Debrief with your research partner—or alone

In the debriefing you mentally go through the research session again and note important insights or new questions. This is easier and more interesting when you researched together with a partner as you can both tell each other your impressions.

Debriefs can vary in length. I suggest scheduling at least 10 minutes, but for an interesting session, you can usually also fill 20 to 30 minutes.

There is no fixed structure for a debriefing, but there are some points that are helpful to look at:

* What was surprising? What led you to change your understanding?
* What was similar to previous research sessions? What matched your expectations?
* What are questions that you could not answer? What are new questions that you have?
* What would you do in the next research session building upon these experiences?

Debriefs are helpful to get an initial structure to what you learned. They also provide closure and are a first preparation to both future research sessions with participants and analyzing the data. They have their strongest effects when done with a research partner. Aside from the advantages of exchanging and combining your experiences, they are also a great social experience that gives a sense of mutual achievement.

### Supplement data from memory

Supplementing your notes, sketches, and diagrams is important: Some data may make perfect sense to you now, but since memory fades, it does not make sense anymore later. Supplement and clarify your data, so you can still comprehend them after your memories of the experience are not fresh anymore.

![You quickly forget about details you heard or saw](images/03_dataGathering_MemoryFades.png){#memoryFades alt="A series of 3 sketches, illustrating forgetting; they loose more and more detail."}

> In my notes I have the line “No Milk.” This can mean many things, so I give some context here. I add to my notes:
> “Needs recipes with _No milk_
> because: milk = stomachache. Dairy free recipes: Vegan blogs as go-to-source”.

Similarly, if my writing is rather messy, I rewrite some words to ensure that I can later decipher what I wrote (See figure <<correctingWritingNotes>>).
I write and draw my supplements in another color than the color of the original notes. When I wrote my notes during the interview with a blue pen, I use black for the supplements or vice versa, since I like to keep track of what I did in which step of the process.

<!-- TODO -->
![A sheet of paper with notes that I annotated after the research session. I rewrote a word that was barely readable (“WASHED”) and added the context information that the person cooking was unsure if they could prepare the lentils quick enough before the onions were done.](images/03_dataGathering_correctNotes.png){#correctingWritingNotes alt="a crop of a sheet of paper with notes that I annotated after the research session. I rewrote a word that was barely readable (“WASHED”) and added the context information that the person cooking was unsure if they could prepare the lentils quick enough before the onions were done."}

Using different colors is useful for another type of supplement: Ideas or remarks in connection to your notes. When I go through the notes, I often have some ideas for a design or a question that I would like to explore in a future interview. I write them down in a third color or I prefix the note with “IDEA:” or “QUESTION” to prevent myself from mixing my ideas with empirical data.

### Transcribe notes

Because they are often written quickly, your notes will usually be rather incoherent: Single words, small sketches, and longer sentences will all be scattered on the paper.


![The clean transcript of the [previous figure](#correctingWritingNotes)](images/03_dataGathering_transcribedNotes.png){#cleanTranscript alt="Clean transcript. Text: Person looking at the next step in the recipe, reads silently. I ask: What do you think?→ I now need to add the washed lentils. I wonder if I can do this before the onions are done. Looks at onions: I guess that’s fine[→she can make it in time"}

Tidy your data and transcribe the notes in a digital document. In your digital document, put one statement in each line.

Avoid tying together two separate statements on one line. This needs to be balanced with another need: Making sure that the data you put into one line is meaningful on its own and is not just a single word or a description free of any context and thus hard to set in relation to other data.

Here are notes that are too short and not meaningful on its own:


> * making space
> * shopping

If there is any way to add the actual context (from memory or by using other notes) these notes should be supplemented with that context. This should help to learn why the person made space and why they went shopping. However, there can also be too much content in one line if it covers several topics at once.

> * For cooking, you need free space in the kitchen, which is often occupied by things, so you need to move stuff around to get the space you need for chopping or peeling vegetables.
> * If they can plan ahead, they go shopping on Saturdays to buy what they need for the coming week, including groceries for cooking. More often though, they go spontaneously, since the supermarket is nearby.

Too much content in each line makes it hard to analyze the data later.

In most cases, you can split lines that cover different observations or statements to multiple lines that still deliver enough content to be understood:

> * Make free space in kitchen for cooking
> * Chopping, Peeling needs free space.
> * Go shopping on Saturdays for the coming week
> * Spontaneous needs no large problem; supermarket nearby.

The notes from the research session and later added supplements from my memory get the same formatting in my documents because they are all data I gathered by listening or observing the participant. But I take care that later added design ideas and research questions are still easily distinguishable from the actual data that I gathered in the research session.

### Supplement from audio recordings

If you made a recording of your research session, use it to supplement and check data.

When the audio contains information which is not in the document or if it supplements information that is already there, pause the playback and write the additional information in the document. The process is very similar to supplementing your notes from memory.

> The audio recording of participant is saying: “I’m kinda lazy and so I like to cook spontaneously and with the ingredients that are just there, you know? ”
> 
> The notes say: “cook spontaneously”
> 
> So I add the information: “cook spontaneously. Use ingredients that are there. because ‘kinda lazy’”


If you need to save time, don't listen to the full recording but go through your notes and see where they lack information. Jump to the parts of the audio that might complement these sections.

### Pseudonymize your notes

When transcribing your notes, it is also a good point in time to pseudonymize them.

Pseudonymization means that you replace identifying information like names, places or job titles with placeholders. So the second user you talked to, “Abigail Miller”, might become P2 (a user code) or “Anna” (a pseudonym). This also depends on the participants’ wishes—some might want to choose a pseudonym or actually appear with the name they usually use. If there is nothing else specified, I use codes.

Aside from names, there might be other data that could identify the participant, for example names of places, institutions, or job titles. If they can identify the participant, replace them with more general placeholders: “Hannover” might become “A city in the north of Germany.”

> _Note:_ If you want to know more about pseudonymization, read [“Anonymising interview data: challenges and compromise in practice”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582834/) (2014) by Saunders, Kitzinger, and Kitzinger).

You can’t make pseudonymization absolutely safe. If your research involves people who need particular protection against identification, you also might want to use a more elaborate way of pseudonymization and data protection—explaining that is beyond the aims of the book and research with vulnerable people is not a good setting to get started with user need research in the first place, anyway.

### Organize and archive your data

It should be easy to find out later which data was from which participant and how notes, sketches, diagrams, and possible audio recordings fit together.

Take care that all sheets of paper and files have the following:

* A participant code like P1 for the first, P2 for the second participant, etcetera. This way you can later trace back which data belongs together.
* The name of the project and the date. In your next or even a parallel project, you may have another “first” participant, and you don’t want to mix them up.
* The filenames (or the names of the folders they are in) should carry the participant code, project name and possibly the method too, which may lead to lengthy filenames like: LearnCooking_P3_diagram_shopping.png—“LearnCooking” being the project name, “P1” is the participant code, “diagram” is the method and “shopping” (by a client of a design) is the topic which is covered in the diagram.
* You should look for possible interconnections between different kinds of data. Maybe the participant mentioned his messy kitchen and you have a photo of it? Add a line in your transcript, referring to the photo. Or the participant talks about the problems of sending data to the print shop and the printing process was part of a workflow diagram you both created? Write a brief line in your notes and the diagram to connect both.

If you take these steps you can still match project and participants later, so you don’t lose time or data because of some tangle.

As a result of these steps, you now have a transcript of your notes, diagrams, sketches, and photos with possible cross-referencing annotations, participant codes, and descriptive filenames.

### Next steps

After a few research sessions you will get the hang of it: The field you research in feels more familiar and you can focus more on details and nuances rather than on grasping what people talk about at all. The basic steps for the research sessions however, will remain the same.

After some sessions, it makes sense to start with analysis, as your results in the analysis can inform upcoming sessions. While it is good practice to weave research sessions and analysis into each other, it might not always be possible.

## Summary

* Introduce yourself, explain how the research will be like and ask for consent.
* There are three types of gathering data: Listening, Observing and Co-Documenting.
* There are four ways of recording data: Actively with notes or sketching, passively with audio recordings and photos.
* Affirm that you listen to the participant: Nodding, saying “uhm” and referring back to what they told you. This shows that you care.
* Be open to how the participant works—don’t impose your own views.
* Delve into topics more deeply by probing, checking your understanding and asking for examples.
* Switch topics and methods to match your research interests.
* After the research session, plan for time to debrief, supplementing notes and organizing data.
